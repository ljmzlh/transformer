We do not want to see our development objectives and priorities sub@@ sumed by foreign policy strategi@@ es, interests and priorities.
   As the au@@ th@@ or is not present, Ques@@ tion No 5 lap@@ ses.
I would like to hear how he intends to improve coordination of the national indic@@ ative programmes for Cotonou and about our invol@@ vement in the ste@@ ering committee working on education in Africa.
We should also be wor@@ ried that this report on public health us@@ es terms such as ‘@@ market@@ ’ and ‘@@ consum@@ ers@@ ’@@ .
Therefore, if someone wants to apply to it due to a European Union decision or the application of Union law, they will first have to apply to the Court of Justice of the European Union for a pre@@ limin@@ ary rul@@ ing.
This is another reason to be open to dialogue.
This confirms that the Secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ Gener@@ al, the Council, and the Commission have the support of the people@@ ’s representatives in Parliament in this endeav@@ our@@ .
Mr President, my group, the Group of the Party of European Soci@@ alists, would like to discuss Afghan@@ ist@@ an and Cub@@ a in Septem@@ ber, provided that both points are well prepared in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy.
This is the task that we fac@@ e.
Because creation has a cre@@ ator@@ .
We can clearly make progress on many of these issues and, therefore, the Presidency will not raise any opposition to the creation of this inter@@ institutional working grou@@ p.
Tur@@ ning now to the Commission President, Mr Pro@@ di@@ .
Com@@ peti@@ tion rules are designed to ensure that the same rules and equal opportunities apply to everyone who oper@@ ates in the internal market.
I hope we are able to take these words to heart.
In conclu@@ sion, I would like to stress that the Commission shares your view on the As@@ sembl@@ y@@ ’s role as a mo@@ de@@ l for cooperation.
A@@ ut@@ om@@ atic@@ ally exclu@@ ding the use of force under any circumstances, as sugges@@ ted, for example, by the German Government, would weak@@ en the position of the international community.
This also appli@@ es, for example, to the very real projects which the Committee on Industry has intro@@ duce@@ d.
Ad@@ mitte@@ dly the report does emphasise that hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y of this kind should be eliminated in the case of China. However, it is not sufficiently strongly wor@@ ded as far as relations with Russia are concerned.
This is yet another document that has signed up to the ten@@ d@@ ency to create institutions that have no sense to them and which take money from the Community's budget.
Both ir@@ responsible exploitation of resources and ill@@ -@@ considered transport flows can have serious eco@@ logical consequ@@ enc@@ es.
Let me c@@ ite the prison@@ ers' ri@@ o@@ t by way of example@@ .
Such up@@ bringing promo@@ tes the development of nar@@ c@@ is@@ s@@ ism and self-@@ cent@@ red@@ ness.
I think that we must be involved in all negotiations as much as possible and have ma@@ x@@ imum access to the meet@@ ings, and I know that you will do your level best in this respec@@ t.
I took it upon myself to con@@ vey what had been discussed and voted on in the House.
Acc@@ ording to recent stu@@ dies, the world's population is growing at a much fas@@ ter rate than global cereal produc@@ tion.
However, as a super@@ vis@@ ory bo@@ dy, it is power@@ less to find out the reality of the ris@@ ks taken by the market play@@ ers.
In addition, I believe that the implementation timetable in our proposal stri@@ k@@ es a good compromise between the immediate future and the time that undertakings actually need to ad@@ just to the new equip@@ ment.
   . – E@@ ven though it is impossible to disagree with the condemnation of the concep@@ t of ‘@@ ’ and of the political mur@@ ders committed in its na@@ me, we have not voted to approve this report.
In Turkey it@@ self, as I have said, recent months have se@@ en a dec@@ line in standards.
The D@@ avi@@ gn@@ on Re@@ port calls these reference rul@@ es.
I strongly rejec@@ t any move to introduce the use of the death penalty.
I hope that I can coun@@ t on the trust and support of the European Parliament as we continue our rigor@@ ous and impartial approach.
I have received a motion for a resolution to w@@ ind up the debate tabled under Rule 108@@ (@@ 5@@ )@@ .
This policy has been undermin@@ ed, both by the system@@ atic clo@@ sure of local slau@@ gh@@ ter@@ h@@ ous@@ es and their re@@ placement by larg@@ er, cent@@ r@@ alised facilities, and by the lack of support for mobil@@ e ab@@ at@@ to@@ ir@@ s.
These agreements are also beneficial at a regional level.
I would like to give you a couple of exam@@ pl@@ es, particularly concerning Community law on the environment.
This is a very serious matter@@ , and we must take note of it.
Ladies and gentlemen, some of what is being called for here is quite simply n@@ on@@ sen@@ se, and I will therefore be voting against the report.
It was Mr Ou@@ z@@ k@@ ý who was not present, and the T@@ able and the President decided to annu@@ l it.
When there are problems in Europe, people con@@ g@@ reg@@ ate in Brussel@@ s: more integration.
A@@ p@@ pro@@ pri@@ ate tax initiatives, which stimul@@ ate modernis@@ ation of the economic structure and citizen activ@@ ity, should also be a prior@@ ity.
How could we not want that, in the wake of the economic crisis in which we still find our@@ sel@@ v@@ es? 20 to 30% of the gross national product of our national econom@@ ies are in pa@@ wn as the res@@ cu@@ e package for the ban@@ ks.
That is why, as e@@ arly as in December of 2001@@ , exactly five years ago, the Council as@@ signed the Commission with setting up a second generation S@@ IS II system. It is vital for the expansion of the Schengen area to include the new Member States.
When we shift our attention to the neighbouring state of Bo@@ s@@ ni@@ a H@@ er@@ ze@@ go@@ v@@ in@@ a, we see the difficulties facing us there and the multi@@ tude of problems that we still have to deal with.
Ad@@ di@@ tion@@ ally, op@@ pon@@ ents of the Treaty have been strengthen@@ ed by their electoral success in the recent Irish general election.
This shows that the Commission is really serious about further developing the internal market.
Finally, Mr President, I should like to mention that on 10@@  December, which was International Human Rights D@@ a@@ y, the Man@@ ο R@@ i@@ ver Women@@ ’s Pe@@ ace N@@ et@@ work was a@@ war@@ ded the UN pri@@ ze for human rights for 200@@ 3.
As the Commissioner has just remin@@ ded us, this is very good - I acknowledge that.
The second message must be that Turkey is faced with a number of ta@@ sk@@ s, including that of being hon@@ est about its history and its gen@@ oci@@ de of one and a half million Ar@@ men@@ i@@ ans, half a million As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans, C@@ hal@@ de@@ ans and S@@ y@@ ri@@ ans and several hundred thousand Gree@@ ks.
The Treaty of Lisbon has been a major step forward in developing the European Parliament's influ@@ ence.
This positive outcome rais@@ es hopes of success for Ger@@ many and for the German Presid@@ ency, and we are pleased with it.
Since research in the area of H@@ I@@ V@@ /@@ A@@ i@@ ds is essenti@@ al, I voted for the resolution.
It is still there.
If you p@@ ass the document on to the relevant services it will be forwar@@ ded to Parliament's security services for investig@@ ation.
We have to dem@@ and that the Government of Bur@@ und@@ i respect the rule of law, end the climate of imp@@ unity and ensure that those gu@@ il@@ ty are s@@ wi@@ f@@ tly brought to justic@@ e.
When we started to look at this proposal we had to bear in mind that it came out of the original discussions on the control of VO@@ C emissi@@ ons from some years ago when we first loo@@ ked at the problem@@ : the emissi@@ on of VO@@ C@@ s from large industrial plants, from large gar@@ ag@@ es, from large pe@@ tro@@ l st@@ ations and so for@@ th.
You have to ad@@ mit that billi@@ ons of human beings are casual@@ ties of progress and that many of them are not guaranteed d@@ rin@@ king water or food on a daily basis.
It is also very important to use the potential of older people in the labour market.
European citizens and taxpayers are rightly paying ever closer attention to the proper spending of EU fund@@ s.
These documents are not addres@@ sed to all young people@@ ; they are, as I said, targe@@ ted at members of parlia@@ ment and national bodies.
If someone does that, how do things stand as regard the trans@@ fer@@ ability of social security and health insurance, or the change@@ over to another system@@ ?
K@@ now@@ ing where the Union's borders are is the key if we are to talk about a European identi@@ ty.
That is not every@@ thing, but it gives a first sign@@ al, takes a first step towards responsibility.
Everyone says certain th@@ ings.
In shor@@ t, Mr President, the steps are being taken and the conditions are in place to move towards what has been described as economic governance of the Union.
H@@ en@@ ce, we need the 2@@ 0% target for renew@@ ab@@ les.
That is also what we were hop@@ ing for, that is the good new@@ s from this summit@@ ; it is what gives us heart.
These were the c@@ hap@@ ter@@ s on statis@@ tic@@ s, small and medium-sized enter@@ pris@@ es, research, education, health and consum@@ ers, as well as foreign relations.
It is not about China.
The great advantage of the Convention is that it b@@ rea@@ ks with traditional methods precisely at this mom@@ ent.
We could speak of cultural management or about giving a new im@@ pe@@ tu@@ s to the one@@ -@@ time idea of Mel@@ ina Mer@@ cour@@ i for a European Cap@@ ital of Culture.
Wo@@ od has become a basic element as a raw materi@@ al, a work material and also as a source of energy.
in writing. - (P@@ T@@ ) Citizen@@ s of Roma origin are often victims of discrimination in the various EU countri@@ es@@ ; since it can take many different forms - affecting their poli@@ tic@@ al, economic, social or cultural rights - it fo@@ st@@ ers pover@@ ty, social exclusion and dis@@ integration.
By defini@@ tion, trade can only take place when markets are opened and trade flows are, in effec@@ t, being liber@@ alised.
C@@ ould it mean more time being offered for such adaptation Europe@@ -@@ wide@@ , as it we@@ re@@ ?
The spring Council in Brussels may not have ans@@ we@@ red ques@@ tions, but it issu@@ ed guidelines which will allow us to put Europe's role into practic@@ e, if we cooperate, if we live in harmon@@ y together, if we fight together for a multi@@ pol@@ ar world.
My mis@@ gi@@ v@@ ings are f@@ oun@@ ded on the simple fact that Turkey is not a European state.
Secondly, training cour@@ ses for dri@@ vers should also pay attention to the r@@ ational use of energy.
I would like to add that the EU's economic, social and territor@@ ial cohesion policy has been neglec@@ ted rec@@ ently in terms of defin@@ ing the European Union's priorities.
Secondly, the scope of the direc@@ tive: I believe that we must hold a genuine political debate at European level on what we mean by services of general interest and the rules that we wish to apply to them.
Ju@@ ven@@ ile offen@@ ders, p@@ reg@@ n@@ ant women and n@@ ur@@ sing mo@@ thers were also exclu@@ ded.
Romania is right when it expres@@ ses the view that the legal basis for Koso@@ vo@@ 's un@@ il@@ ateral declar@@ ation of independence is highly dubious as, under international law, minor@@ ities do not have collective rights and do not enjoy the right to self-@@ de@@ termin@@ ation and sec@@ ession either.
I would like to express my gr@@ ati@@ tude to the Members of the European Parliament, not only for their speech@@ es, but also their valu@@ able sugges@@ tions and ideas for further action.
As regards information on this subject, we have our cooperation on employment services, the EURES cooperation. EURES cooperation has developed in recent years.
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling occur@@ s when it brings in a lot of money.
That is a clear altern@@ ative.
Is it not strange that the Member State that supplies 9@@ 0% of the EU's f@@ ro@@ zen st@@ ra@@ w@@ ber@@ ries had to wa@@ it so long for a decision to introduce protec@@ tive custom@@ s tariff@@ s?
However, the Parliament@@ ary commissi@@ on no@@ tes that Member States have repe@@ ate@@ dly ref@@ used EU scrutin@@ y of their human rights policies and placed the protection of human rights on a purely national basis, thereby undermin@@ ing the Community's credibility in the protection of fundamental rights in the international a@@ ren@@ a.
A balance must be struck between strengthening consumer rights and cutting red ta@@ pe@@ .
Than@@ k@@ fully my group has tabled amendments that m@@ iti@@ g@@ ate some of these shortcomings in the Commission proposal.
(DE) Mr President, in order to reduce Europe's dependence on Russia for its supplies of energy, we should take natural gas from the C@@ as@@ p@@ ian bas@@ in through the South Ca@@ uc@@ asu@@ s to the EU.
H@@ ere we have another potential public health dang@@ er, and given the reply that the President-in-Office has just provi@@ ded, could I say that things should be taken more seriously.
Ch@@ ech@@ n@@ y@@ a
Ag@@ ain democratic rights are in their line of fi@@ re.
How can we spread the application of high European standards to other countri@@ es?
There is pre@@ judic@@ e at work here, which - without going into our programme - is reducing the d@@ ar@@ k@@ est hour of European history to a political spec@@ tac@@ le.
Once we get to the stage where we have a v@@ acc@@ ine or some way of identi@@ fying or testing if an animal has B@@ SE@@ , then there is an argument for testing the rest of the herd and if there is a tri@@ g@@ ger level whereby it go@@ es beyond that, then the whole herd should be taken out.
So now, Commissioner, at second reading we are down to the last few details.
It may simply be because the elec@@ tion of individuals to the Commission on Human Rights bu@@ rea@@ u is based on nomination by regional group@@ s: it was the Afric@@ an@@ s' turn to nom@@ in@@ ate, and they cho@@ se an individual from Lib@@ y@@ a.
The local elections which will take place in two months are an even more important lit@@ mus pap@@ er, which will open up the prospec@@ t for relations.
A@@ re you aware of these inci@@ d@@ ents, and is the Council considering taking joint action to free or loc@@ ate these fellow citizen@@ s?
We cannot start to fight terrorism unless we are su@@ re, on the basis of the moral streng@@ th of our convictions, that we will be able to be@@ at terroris@@ m.
We on the Christian Democrat side of the House support the common position and hope that the Commissioner will table a proposal for a follow@@ up regulation without dela@@ y, so that we do not find ourselves in 1999 discussing the follow-@@ up regulation for 199@@ 8.
As some speeches have demon@@ strate@@ d, these respon@@ ses are dangerous because they offer f@@ al@@ se and appa@@ rently simple solutions to problems which are real and comple@@ x@@ .
I do not want to see any more tortured looks on our side wh@@ en, in delegation talks with China for example, we raise the issues of the death penal@@ ty, F@@ al@@ u@@ n G@@ ong or Ti@@ bet@@ . These tortured looks are due to fe@@ ars, per@@ hap@@ s, that taking a stance could j@@ e@@ op@@ ar@@ dis@@ e good busin@@ ess.
However, we can say something very important and that is that this time we have taken decisi@@ ons, this time we have ac@@ ted.
In 2005@@ , the United States implemented a programme of extending day@@ light sa@@ ving time by four weeks - an additional three weeks in the spring and an additional week in the au@@ tu@@ m@@ n.
The Council has rightly asked the High Representative to bring forward proposals in this area and I urge him to involve Parliament in this.
The vote will take place tomorrow@@ .
Just so we can put this beyond dispute for on@@ ce@@ : for the taxpay@@ er, it is essenti@@ ally ir@@ relevant whether it is a question of fraud or irregular@@ ity@@ ; the money has been improperly sp@@ ent.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for the approach he has taken.
That is what seems important to me, their d@@ yn@@ am@@ ism and the you@@ th@@ ful@@ ness of their convictions, together with their European quali@@ fications and their authority, which is something that we shall need.
It is like@@ wise important to guarantee that the protection of data and priv@@ acy in telecommunications services costs subscri@@ bers nothing.
I agree that we do not nee@@ d, as other colleagues have said, first@@ - and secon@@ d-@@ class fisher@@ men.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the broad consensus about my report and that of my fellow Members Mr C@@ leg@@ g and Mr N@@ ic@@ hol@@ son, I can be bri@@ ef, and shall be using no more spe@@ a@@ king time than is necess@@ ary.
It is my hope that all this agreement will give us the necessary stimul@@ us to at last bring about in reality what we o@@ we to the public - a greater degree of security even when enlarge@@ ment has taken place.
At@@ tention must be paid to ensuring a high level of cohesion between EU Structural Funds, public finances in Member States and private contribu@@ tions.
If they no longer require appro@@ val, this su@@ rely means more freedom for the Member States.
I call on the Commission to prove that it hon@@ ours the undertakings which it made just two months ago before the European Parliament.
Mr Vic@@ he@@ a is the fif@@ th member of the opposition Alliance of Democr@@ ats to have been murdered in 2004@@ , and the latest victi@@ m of a year of violence.
Therefore, the Commission done the right thing in present@@ ing us with this Gre@@ en P@@ ap@@ er, which we are examining today thanks to the report by our fellow Mem@@ ber, Mrs M@@ organ@@ .
(The sit@@ ting was opened at 9 a@@ .@@ m@@ .@@ )
Col@@ leagu@@ es will remember that, a number of years ago, we discussed a directive on consumer cre@@ d@@ it, and the whole area of transparency and of having independent ad@@ vic@@ e available to the consumers was one key ele@@ ment.
However, we should take into consideration the financial and economic aspects en@@ tailed by these propos@@ als.
If we place the emphasis on this, we shall also be at the cutting ed@@ ge of the technological development which is a pre@@ requ@@ is@@ ite for a competitive Europe.
If that is possible@@ , we will be able to accept it, Mr President.
We do@@ , of course, also have the great advantage of having an independent public authority, the European Court of A@@ ud@@ itor@@ s, as our external au@@ d@@ itor@@ .
But the price of our in@@ diffe@@ rence and self@@ ish@@ ness will undoubtedly be far high@@ er, because they th@@ re@@ ate@@ n to depri@@ ve the countries of Central and Eastern Europe of political prospects which are essential to the success of their transi@@ tion.
Let us just think about what we have in common and what we want to achieve together.
We must begin to invest more in basic research, and we have to exp@@ and the scope of public funding for research and development.
The Group of the Gre@@ en@@ s@@ /@@ European F@@ ree Alliance fully supports this resolution.
I cannot believe what is going on@@ !
We know how many of them are men and how many are women.
We should be a be@@ ac@@ on of hope and tran@@ qu@@ ill@@ ity for those who wish to have their viewpoint hear@@ d.
If I analy@@ se these weakn@@ ess@@ es, I do not reach the conclusion that we should be mutually agree@@ ing not to get involved at this point. In@@ stead@@ , I conclude that more mutual responsibility and more solidarity must be ac@@ compani@@ ed by mutual inter@@ vention.
L@@ and@@ min@@ es and their su@@ spec@@ ted presence are one of the gre@@ atest obstacles to reconstruction and return to any sort of norm@@ al@@ ity.
They share the inform@@ ation.
At the same time, this resolution aims at trying to reas@@ sure the people of C@@ had that the European Union stands by their side in their hour of need and will continue to do its ut@@ most in order to assist in the achie@@ vement of peace and prosper@@ ity for all the citizens of their country.
The next item is the report (A@@ 5-@@ 0@@ 21@@ 0@@ /200@@ 1@@ ) by Mr B@@ us@@ k, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Develop@@ ment, on the proposal for a Council Directive [@@ C@@ O@@ M@@ (@@ 2001@@ ) 20 - C@@ 5-00@@ 3@@ 9/200@@ 1 - 2001@@ /@@ 00@@ 21@@ (C@@ N@@ S)] amen@@ ding Directive 9@@ 1@@ /@@ 6@@ 3@@ 0@@ /@@ E@@ E@@ C l@@ aying down minimum standards for the protection of pig@@ s.
Th@@ ose who have voted for myself are independent Members from small and large groups who do not feel that they have had all their wishes me@@ t.
En@@ velop@@ es and bal@@ lot pap@@ ers have been distribu@@ ted.
Because if we simply go ham@@ mer@@ ing on about infrastruc@@ ture and not about the right way of using it, do not ensure the us@@ er@@ -@@ friend@@ lin@@ ess of teach@@ ing material in the educ@@ ational environment and do not actually make it available and keep it up to date day by day, then it will all come to nothing.
In this sense the energy networks differ from the trans-European network@@ s, which recei@@ ve large amounts of public money.
   Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what I have to say on the subject of the vote on Bulgari@@ a and Romania I say on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrat@@ s, and it is that it was our group that was the mo@@ ti@@ vating force behind yester@@ day@@ ’s debate.
Any new EU rules on char@@ ging he@@ av@@ y goods vehicles must mainta@@ in a balance between the environmental needs and economic interests of the new Member States.
I also hope that there will soon be a ju@@ dgement ensuring that citizens are not only entitled to form trade uni@@ ons but also to be free to join them.
And this is very ob@@ vious to the popul@@ ation, as was evid@@ ent from the figures brought by Mrs L@@ al@@ um@@ i@@ è@@ re, but as we heard a moment ago, this message is not all that popul@@ ar yet in many regi@@ ons.
He@@ re, on behalf of the Socialist Group and also person@@ ally as K@@ ater@@ ina B@@ at@@ ze@@ li@@ , I shall applaud any measure proposed by the Commission that mainta@@ ins balance on the question of en@@ rich@@ ing with su@@ g@@ ar, because, as has also been said by the Socialist Grou@@ p@@ , we have contributed to a balanced motion in order to avoid creating transitional problems.
I therefore com@@ men@@ d the specific amendments from the E@@ LD@@ R Group - Amend@@ ments No@@ s 11@@ 0 to 11@@ 2.
The Council wanted the European Parliament to reform its relations with its assistants in the n@@ ame of transparency.
I agree with Mr B@@ ö@@ sch and other speak@@ ers that we have an exten@@ sive range of rules and programmes that may give rise to the possibility of frau@@ d, but also offer great scope for mis@@ management and we@@ ak control.
The E@@ ri@@ k@@ a oil spill is one of a cat@@ alogu@@ e of disasters that have taken place in recent years in Community water@@ s, including the Bra@@ er spill off S@@ he@@ t@@ land and the Se@@ a E@@ m@@ press off W@@ al@@ es.
Qu@@ ite ap@@ ar@@ t from that, have you even f@@ ound a political solution to the problem@@ ?
I hope that, as Mr D@@ ell@@ '@@ Al@@ b@@ a said, l@@ ou@@ d vo@@ ices will be raised in support of this military trib@@ un@@ al because other@@ wise the risk is that we will ask for it but not get a hear@@ ing.
It is in C@@ open@@ ha@@ g@@ en that the decision should be taken@@ , and that decision should include everything that is important for the climate.
Moreover, I shall be tabl@@ ing an amendment in this regard when we discuss the report by Mr Sta@@ es during our April part-session.
The European Parliament has already sought better information on proce@@ ed@@ ings involving breach@@ es, through a formal request in the resolution of 4 F@@ e@@ b@@ ru@@ ary 201@@ 0@@ .
S@@ o, who@@ ever tries to change the situation in the Brussels peri@@ ph@@ er@@ y using this convention will implic@@ it@@ ly put the future of the Belgian constitutional equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um at risk and illu@@ strate once again that a European lack of in@@ sight into our federal system can lead one to think that we would be better off as the se@@ par@@ ate Member States of F@@ lan@@ ders and W@@ all@@ onia, rather than as a federal Member State of Belgi@@ um@@ .
We are not prof@@ lig@@ ate@@ ; we are not w@@ as@@ te@@ ful@@ ; we do not do things because we just want to do them on a wh@@ im@@ .
These elections were not democrati@@ c.
We do not want to exclude small appli@@ anc@@ es, Mr @@ Sch@@ w@@ ab@@ , because it is not just wr@@ ist@@ wat@@ ch@@ es that we are talking ab@@ out, but fire ex@@ ting@@ u@@ ish@@ ers and similar small appli@@ an@@ ces that are relatively danger@@ ou@@ s.
In that case, Mr President of the Commission, I have to ask you whether he was with you in the Maoist youth move@@ ment, for if he we@@ re, that would make him the only Maoist billi@@ on@@ ai@@ re in Europe.
Ne@@ ed@@ less to say, there are all kinds of ex@@ cus@@ es for these wrong@@ s.
E@@ duc@@ ation is more than voc@@ ational tra@@ in@@ ing.
So what exactly are we talking ab@@ out@@ ?
   Mr President, as that will be one of this year@@ ’s most exciting and important issues, I would like to ask the Presidency of the Council whether it might not be reasonable for the Council to report to the public and to this House, at certain inter@@ val@@ s, on how negotiations are actually progress@@ ing, for they are being con@@ duc@@ ted by the Member States rather than by the Commission.
At bes@@ t, schem@@ es of this kind could be described as welf@@ are@@ -@@ promoting measures with no stimul@@ ating effect on employment.
Firstly, what efforts will the Luxem@@ bour@@ g Presidency make to ensure that the timetable of adoption in December is adhe@@ red to@@ ?
The second reason is the new situation since the people of Gaz@@ a have opened up the border@@ .
The members of the College committed themselves to organising ten training operations on the priority issues set out in the Council Dec@@ isi@@ on.
The third area concerns a sensitive but important issue.
20 % of economic activ@@ ity in Europe is directly or in@@ directly related to tour@@ ism.
The decisions taken by the Council during the Irish Presidency were – and continue to be – a good start in our efforts to prevent car@@ di@@ o@@ v@@ as@@ c@@ ul@@ ar diseases.
We also held the Common G@@ round joint sim@@ ulation exercise last week to te@@ st our plans and those of the Member States.
The question of the 199@@ 4 ai@@ d, which the Commission appro@@ ved, is being re@@ opened but, at the same time, the Commission has failed totally to react to com@@ ments made in the European Parliament by Members such as myself on the competition for the s@@ ale of Olympic A@@ ir@@ ways.
With@@ in Rom@@ an@@ ia, too, endeav@@ ours to reg@@ ain M@@ ol@@ do@@ v@@ a have become less urgent@@ .
The first key element is that it is cr@@ u@@ cial in terms of our future prospects of cat@@ ch@@ ing up to recognising the particularly close lin@@ k that exists between jo@@ b creation and the economic policies promoting it, and the social systems that represent the primar@@ y pil@@ lar@@ s of social inclu@@ sion.
(The President dec@@ l@@ ared the common position appro@@ ve@@ d@@ )
Mr Ma@@ to Ad@@ ro@@ ver and Mr T@@ ei@@ x@@ ei@@ ra@@ , I can show you the figu@@ res.
In this connec@@ tion, I should first like to empha@@ size three particularly important points.
Mr Sep@@ p@@ än@@ en, your question indic@@ ates that you are clearly con@@ f@@ us@@ ed, unless there has been an interpreting error@@ .
This is preferable to op@@ ting in favour of dom@@ es@@ tic Joint Implementation Pro@@ jec@@ ts, as is being suggested by som@@ e.
in writing. - (PL) The global economic crisis has me@@ ant that the financial situation of many Pol@@ ish companies has wor@@ sen@@ ed.
S@@ i@@ x@@ th@@ ly, I would p@@ us@@ h for pro@@ duce@@ r liability to play its full par@@ t.
Moreover, the adoption of new polic@@ e measures is tail@@ o@@ red to the same pat@@ ter@@ n and based on the same low level of self-@@ knowledge@@ .
No un@@ necessary del@@ ay@@ s; every far@@ mer wants to know the exact content of their animal fe@@ ed.
I believe that it is high time, Mr President, that we had some effective legislation, which is rigor@@ ous, of course, but simple in terms of form and common to all European countries, which takes account of the needs of both the s@@ ou@@ thern and northern countries.
Any strategy on sustainable development must take account of this in@@ equality and of the fact that social problems affect men and women in different ways.
Member States should be aware that many of their problems, but especially many of the immigr@@ ant refuge@@ es' problems, would be overcome if these appl@@ ications were dealt with quick@@ ly.
One major aspect of that is in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably and rightly a shift away from own-initiative reports from committe@@ es, with no legislative im@@ pac@@ t, to focus@@ sing more on legislation.
Secondly, the G@@ S@@ P@@ + incentive sche@@ me, which provi@@ des additional benefits for countries implementing certain international standards in human and labour rights, environmental protec@@ tion, the fight against d@@ rug@@ s, and good governance.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will ech@@ o some of what my fellow Members have been saying before me, but I think it is important to show that all groups in this House are unanimous in their condemnation of recent events in I@@ ran@@ .
How can it even occur to the Slov@@ ak Ministry of the En@@ viron@@ ment to support and recommend such a power plan@@ t?
Min@@ or improvements and min@@ or chan@@ g@@ es, with limited and me@@ ag@@ re subsi@@ dies, compensation and funds do not change the spirit or the objective of the proposed regul@@ ation.
We should certainly not get bogged down in min@@ u@@ te technical details.
The fact is that such immigr@@ ants who have come from central and e@@ astern Europe into the UK, S@@ we@@ den and Ireland have not been a dra@@ in on the economy, but a benefit to it.
Furthermore, this resolution conta@@ ins many initiatives highligh@@ t@@ ing, for in@@ stan@@ ce, the fight against youth unemployment or in favour of a dec@@ ent pen@@ sion and proposing a European Pact for the over-@@ 50@@ s.
B@@ 5-00@@ 8@@ 9/200@@ 2 by Mrs L@@ yn@@ ne on behalf of the Group of the European Liber@@ al, Democrat and Re@@ form Party,
I therefore propose that a world@@ wide campai@@ gn be launched to ti@@ e in with UN@@ IC@@ E@@ F programmes promoting the rights of children and young people throughout Latin America.
Unfortunately, a new mind@@ set for the Structural Funds and for their adaptation to the financing of the Lisbon Strategy has become pre@@ val@@ ent.
Both the Council and the ACP group fully share the concerns rel@@ ating to this question.
The scope of spending on weap@@ on@@ ry is growing danger@@ ous@@ ly, having reached almost EUR 40 billion last year.
In my report, I propose that countries which have not introduced number por@@ ta@@ bility by 1 January 2000 should be regar@@ ded as countries where full competition on the telecommunications market has not yet been achie@@ ved, so that the public are regularly made aware that their country is not yet ge@@ ared up and that consumers are therefore paying too mu@@ ch@@ .
There are also long-@@ standing ties with the Communist International in the regi@@ on.
Man@@ 's contribution to war@@ ming over the last dec@@ ade is a strong prob@@ abil@@ ity.
I must also highlight a recent sur@@ vey publ@@ ished by Euro@@ bar@@ om@@ e@@ ter, which confirms that the environment, together with sec@@ ur@@ ity, health and unemployment, is one of the main issues of concern to the citizens of the European Union.
Furthermore, a guaranteed number of rights will apply independ@@ ently of the dist@@ ance travel@@ led.

The Council also supports the Commission in its efforts to investig@@ ate the potential for technical cooperation programmes to assist neighbouring countries - in particular the applic@@ ant countries, Russia and within the EU@@ RO@@ -@@ M@@ E@@ D framework - in their efforts to increase maritime safety and pol@@ lu@@ tion prevention, including the effective application of adequate port state control procedu@@ res.
That also applies to the direc@@ tion of development in bio@@ technology.
Therefore, Europe ow@@ es an en@@ orm@@ ous histor@@ ical debt, cent@@ u@@ ries ol@@ d, to Afric@@ a, and should repay it, not only by means of asking for@@ gi@@ ven@@ ess, but also by forging soci@@ al, economic, political and cultural links in order to show an in@@ dis@@ pen@@ s@@ able form of solidar@@ ity.
I voted in favour of this report in order to acknowledge the structural problems that the College has been facing for many years now.
As the Commissioner said, this is a key part of the Lisbon A@@ gen@@ d@@ a, which we support.
I am very g@@ la@@ d about this successful work together, and I hope that this important directive can now be fin@@ alised.
It must be pointed out that the Commission proposal does not take account of any changes which may result from the Community' s climate change commit@@ ments.
T@@ ri@@ m@@ T@@ ab@@ s In@@ v@@ est@@ ment Resear@@ ch, a leading US independent research service, has said that if their margin requirement was raised between 25% and 50@@ %@@ , which is the same as most people who invest in the stock market pa@@ y, it would have a significant impact on low@@ ering oil prices.
That has been achieved with the help of the Commission and also with the Member States and the industry.
It is on this basis that we shall continue our work within the framework of the own-initiative reports on the union of the Nor@@ th African A@@ ra@@ b countries which will be submitted to the House at the May part-session.
Therefore, the fight against crime in all its forms - including terrorism, or rather, starting with terrorism - is and will remain at the top of our agenda.
In the debate in the Committee on Economic Affair@@ s Mr V@@ on Wo@@ ga@@ u also confir@@ med that the criteria would be of this minimum n@@ at@@ ure.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (@@ N@@ L) Mr President, last wee@@ k, the so-@@ called Palestini@@ an F@@ at@@ ah@@ -@@ Hamas unity government came to a viol@@ ent end.
We have a crisis in Irel@@ and@@ ; my colleagues G@@ ay M@@ it@@ ch@@ ell@@ , P@@ at the C@@ ope G@@ all@@ ag@@ her and myself have tabled ques@@ tions.
So let us also give the young people of Europe a ch@@ ance by increasing the funding for this.
Croatia asked to join the European Mon@@ itoring Centre for D@@ rug@@ s and D@@ ru@@ g Ad@@ dic@@ tion in 2005@@ .
on behalf of the E@@ CR Group. - Madam President, Serbia's progress towards EU member@@ ship is ga@@ ther@@ ing pac@@ e, and rightly so, as evid@@ enced by the excellent K@@ ac@@ in report.
I believe that by taking this kind of action we are ful@@ f@@ illing our duty not only to the current generation but to future gener@@ ations as well.
In parts this seems to be more concerned with protecting the civil rights of terroris@@ ts than with condemning their mur@@ der@@ ous be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our towards innocent civilians.
When will Parliament be able to have this impact assess@@ ment, before it has been totally re@@ wr@@ itten by your services, Commission@@ er@@ ?
One commitment is to co@@ di@@ fy the health and safety directive.
(DE) Madam President, the European Protection Order is a step in the right direction.
It is necessary to introduce a European quality mar@@ k for agricultural products.
We need to recognise that the continu@@ ation of food production in Europe depends on a commitment to the sector and a recognition that it cannot be expected to survi@@ ve the on@@ slau@@ ght of un@@ limited market access by low@@ -@@ co@@ st commodities produced outside the Union at different and lower standards.
How can we create new market@@ s?
I would like to make one final point.
Ladies and gentlemen, has the European Commission not taken the time to read my report on the origin of im@@ ports of fisher@@ y and a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ulture products in the European Uni@@ on@@ ?
In any case we must, I thin@@ k, here too, take a positive view of the progress made@@ .
Al@@ low me to give you three exam@@ ples of strange coordination that I myself have come across in pr@@ acti@@ ce during my travel@@ s.
G@@ l@@ ori@@ fication of terrorism is never accep@@ table@@ , so we need a zer@@ o-@@ tolerance strategy towards crimes against our society.
It is in the nature of all decisions in plenary that they be taken from a political point of view@@ . In this case we are talking about a purely formal legal assessment.
The Member States should not forget that these are public funds and, as su@@ ch, the concern of all the citizens of Europe.
Everyone knows that in current writing journalists who do not con@@ form are eliminated very disc@@ ree@@ tly and shi@@ f@@ ti@@ ly. There is no need for direct orders by governments.
As the law stands at present, only the institution as a whole can be sanc@@ tioned.
We take a some@@ what so@@ f@@ ter line with Africa.
Would it not be sim@@ ple@@ r if the Member States were granted a sum of money alloc@@ ated on the basis of per capita G@@ N@@ P, taking account of levels of unemployment, population den@@ s@@ ity and cli@@ m@@ atic condi@@ tion@@ s?
These recom@@ mend@@ ations will include dead@@ lines which will have been decided according to the Stability and Growth P@@ ac@@ t, i.e. taking into consideration the exis@@ tence of special circumstances, where appropri@@ ate.
Iran is a great country and we do not want it to isol@@ ate itself from the international community.
Is the Commission prepared to re@@ consider its decision to withdraw conventional light b@@ ul@@ b@@ s from the marke@@ t?
I therefore welcome the fact that the Commission has star@@ ted, in cooperation with Parliament, to develop new programmes for the period post@@ -@@ 2007@@ .
To vote in favour of the Sta@@ un@@ er report is to vote for post@@ pon@@ ement of granting discharge which, all things conside@@ red, we believe should be granted now.
I shall re@@ fra@@ in from drawing any conclu@@ sions, just as those who have spoken before me have done.
It is vital not to lo@@ se sight of this objective.
Firstly, it seems to me that the provisions of the E@@ ner@@ gy Charter ought definitely to be included in the new partnership and cooperation agreement between the European Union and Russi@@ a.
And I do mean '@@ ass@@ ent@@ ' l@@ iter@@ ally.
1. Sudan and South Sudan (
Th@@ us we can see that this comes to EUR 1 9@@ 0@@ 2 for each of the R@@ en@@ aul@@ t-linked workers made redundant and EUR 1 19@@ 0 for each of the Pe@@ uge@@ o@@ t-linked workers made redund@@ ant.
I think everyone – including Mr D@@ ev@@ a, who has just spoken – has made it clear that, as far as Parliament is concerned, both the economic resources and the organis@@ ational measures are guarante@@ ed.
But before com@@ ment@@ ing on the content of the agreement and to consequences to be expected from it, I should like, on behalf of the Committee on F@@ isher@@ ies, to give my s@@ inc@@ ere thanks to the Commission for its collaboration and the rapid@@ ity with which it has continually pass@@ ed on information throughout the seven months of negotiations - an effort which is if possible all the more p@@ ra@@ ise@@ worthy bearing in mind the difficulty and the many times things ground to a hal@@ t@@ ; we trust that such collaboration will set a stand@@ ard for future ac@@ tions.
The more ex@@ emp@@ tions, the more frau@@ d.
It is c@@ ast in very different language from y@@ ours, gentlemen@@ .
S@@ et@@ ting a specific target for bio@@ gas would introduce further administrative bur@@ den@@ s for private operators and public authorities.
Would you like it to be a federal Europe with an elected govern@@ ment@@ ?
We can only welcome that, because education and training are essential ele@@ ments in forging closer links between peop@@ les.
The prime objective is development, and that also involves a flexible approach that makes it possible to take into account the economic weakn@@ esses of the countries concerned, which we are trying to strengthen@@ .
Mr President, there is no freedom of religi@@ on in Vietnam@@ .
The European Union has a duty to op@@ pose such re@@ tro@@ g@@ res@@ sion, which is being attemp@@ ted mainly by Islam@@ ic fundament@@ alists once more against women, and should raise its vo@@ ice to def@@ end women@@ s' rights which are after all human rights too.
We must take into account that even though gender equality is an absolu@@ te requirement for exercising fully our basic human rights and a fundamental principle of the European Union, inequalities pers@@ ist in the political sphere and in women's lives.
We accept the position of the majority in favour of a legal situation with uni@@ form rules for the entire Union, although I will not sp@@ are Members the fact that such a solution also clearly im@@ plies a certain degree of un@@ f@@ air@@ ness.
It is also essential that the Commission's monitoring system be extended to the field of intergovernmental cooperation and to the com@@ itology system.
I should add that the Presidency shares this objective and I hope, Mr P@@ fl@@ ü@@ g@@ er, that this year we will have more luc@@ k and succe@@ ed in achiev@@ ing it or at least, as I said in the introduc@@ tion, make major progress in this direction.
Mr President, Commission@@ ers, I have five very specific questions to as@@ k.
Food is something that we cannot play with.
If one talks about increasing employment in Europe, one should also be talking about reform@@ ing pen@@ sions for those in work.
'@@ The Union may take initiatives to ensure coordination of [@@ ..@@ .@@ ] social policies@@ .'
E@@ vid@@ ently, only an administrative appe@@ al is possible against such a ban on ent@@ ering US territory.
With regard to the H@@ erman report, the legal status of the European currency will have to be such as to ensure the ir@@ re@@ versi@@ bility and credibility of the process but also such as to avoid the exc@@ ess costs resulting from a dual national@@ /@@ euro currency system.
In addition, dri@@ ving lic@@ ences often function as a form of identi@@ fic@@ ation, which means that ver@@ i@@ fication aspects are important.
(@@ B@@ G@@ ) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the moment there is a danger han@@ ging over Bulgari@@ an society.
May@@ be we could ask for a convention now if they want to change the treat@@ y.
In addition, the document defin@@ es minimum framework standards to ensure protection against discrimination.
This sm@@ oul@@ dering fire of national@@ ism ought to have been put out in Slovak@@ ia immedi@@ ate@@ ly.
In the mean@@ time, our B@@ re@@ ton farm@@ s, for example, are reloc@@ ating to Bra@@ z@@ il – the leader in poultry far@@ ming – where not only are the ch@@ ic@@ ken@@ s un@@ protec@@ ted, but the children are too.
That provisi@@ on for equi@@ val@@ ent protection of the budget is a new element in the Union's anti-fraud strategy and over time it will clearly vast@@ ly improve control@@ s.
In particular, those of us who live on the border between Belgium and Ger@@ man@@ y, where we see thousands and thousands of l@@ or@@ ries pass@@ ing each day, know that transport is a cross-border affair and calls for solutions at European level.
But I am one of the people who took the initiative and I am still here, just as I am here every F@@ ri@@ day.
Mr President, it is a pity that an en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ tic majority in the Committee on Women@@ 's Rights and Gender Equality is trying hard to over@@ lo@@ ad our position on the Committe@@ e@@ 's annual report on equality between men and women in the European Union with considerations and cla@@ im@@ s that are counter@@ produc@@ tive for women and which har@@ m, among other things, their chan@@ ces of employment.
That legal person@@ ality depends on the r@@ ati@@ fication of the European Constitution that the European Union intends to stuff down the thro@@ ats of the peop@@ les of Europe whether they want it or no@@ t.
H@@ e is so isol@@ ated he pro@@ bab@@ ly will never hear of the debate here today.
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, the F@@ our@@ th European Uni@@ on-@@ Latin Americ@@ a and C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an S@@ um@@ mit@@ , last spring in Vi@@ en@@ n@@ a, ga@@ ve the green light to the start of negotiations of a strategic association agreement between Europe and the An@@ de@@ an Commun@@ ity.
A firm and responsible approach is therefore require@@ d, aimed at promoting knowledge@@ , cooper@@ ation, respect and mutual understanding.
There are the attacks on towns and the con@@ st@@ ant attacks on the civilian popul@@ ation; and those who live in those parts know that mean@@ while in the bar@@ s on the borders the s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers are trading with each other.
Tunisi@@ a
However, I have to repeat that ultimate@@ ly, of course, this is also the responsibility of each and every Member State@@ ; but we will certainly try to support those actions that the UN has already taken.
They affect not only the social security systems, but also the public sector.
The ac@@ qu@@ is commun@@ au@@ tai@@ re to which I referred earli@@ er on enlarge@@ ment, co@@ vers 2 50@@ 0 legislative acts over 50 years and 8@@ 5 000 p@@ ages of legislation.
It is, however, important to continue to make use of the opportunities for innovation that IC@@ T offer us.
The time has therefore come to re@@ visit the D@@ u@@ bl@@ in regulation urgent@@ ly, so that we can take joint responsibility for these situ@@ ations throughout Europe, sho@@ wing solidarity and a human@@ is@@ tic approach.
O@@ ur aim is that, under the new policy agreement on the promotion of bilateral economic relations, a political figure from each side should be appoin@@ ted to move the EU@@ /@@ USA summit process forwar@@ d, and we have suggested to the United States that these pers@@ ons, or cont@@ acts as they are ter@@ med, should be adv@@ ised by a small inform@@ al group com@@ posed of people chosen from legislative bo@@ dies, business associ@@ ations and consum@@ ers' groups.
It is essential to effec@@ tively coordinate the resources available so as to reach the target group@@ s, and for us to be certain that there are no errors of the kind already identi@@ fied in documents which the Commission has widely distributed in Portuguese s@@ cho@@ ol@@ s.
European Union Member States should continue to support Croati@@ a's reform program@@ me, paying particular attention to its most pressing problems, namely cor@@ r@@ up@@ tion, high levels of unemployment and the difficult situation the fra@@ g@@ mented agricultural sector fin@@ ds itself in.
No@@ w@@ ad@@ ays, we can no longer make peace by w@@ aging war@@ .
Finally, we would stress the need for the emerg@@ ence of a democratic area between the two se@@ abo@@ ards.
I would like to know how this rest st@@ ation project is progress@@ ing.
The Commission strategy, even in this difficult economic situation, is to deal with any discrimination, any breach@@ es of the principle of equal opportun@@ ities.
I very warmly welcome the interest shown by Parliament and share its concern with regard to the gra@@ ve consequences of the floo@@ ds affecting mainly Pol@@ and and the Cz@@ ech Re@@ public@@ .
For all these reasons, we congratulate the rapporteur@@ , Mr K@@ ou@@ k@@ i@@ ad@@ is.
For the sa@@ ke of effici@@ ency, I then end@@ or@@ sed the idea of a temporary committee.
That means that we are using around 20 million h@@ ec@@ ta@@ res of arable land in other countries or, to put it another way, out@@ sour@@ cing 1@@ 0% of our arable land to other countries for the culti@@ vation of pro@@ te@@ in crop@@ s.
- A@@ 6@@ -01@@ 0@@ 5@@ /200@@ 6 by U@@ m@@ ber@@ to Gu@@ id@@ on@@ i, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the discharge for the implementation of the budget of the European Food Safety Au@@ thor@@ ity for the financial year 2004 [@@ 2005@@ /21@@ 19@@ (DE@@ C@@ )@@ ]@@ .
   . – It is a fact that the Mediterranean is of strategic importance to the whole of Europe and that we need to develop a Mediterranean policy based on solidarity in order to act on the multi@@ ple shared challenges of peace, stabil@@ ity, terrorism, mutual understand@@ ing, the fight against trafficking in people, and the objective of creating a shared area of prosper@@ ity.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by than@@ king the te@@ am of Fisch@@ l@@ er, Lam@@ y and Ne@@ y@@ ts most warmly for getting a new round of talks together.
They also decided to act in accordance with the Council of Europe Declar@@ ation, Programme of A@@ c@@ tion and Resolution on democrati@@ s@@ ation, conflict prevention and peac@@ e-@@ build@@ ing.
That is the tru@@ th of the matter.
On the contrary, I think what we have to do as a strategy is to have a comb@@ ination of sustain@@ ing Afghan@@ istan@@ 's long-term development and offering farm@@ ers altern@@ atives to pop@@ p@@ y culti@@ v@@ ation, combined with improved governance.
Me@@ asu@@ res taken by governments in the E@@ uro area to re@@ organ@@ ise public finances have created a basis for sustainable economic growth and a strengthening of the euro.
Let us look at the electoral debate today in Portu@@ g@@ al.
T@@ rac@@ eability rules should be established so that this is done even when the presence of GM@@ O D@@ N@@ A cannot be identi@@ fi@@ ed.
I therefore wish for 200@@ 8@@ , Mr Man@@ del@@ son, that together we can consider the tex@@ ti@@ le sector@@ 's b@@ right future in a more peaceful climate.
S@@ ub@@ jec@@ t@@ : C@@ re@@ ating a common European conscience
I had no cho@@ ic@@ e, therefore, but to abstain@@ .
One alternative is of course mobility of labour@@ , which ho@@ we@@ ver also caus@@ es social problems.
I think it is a dangerous illu@@ sion to ig@@ n@@ ore the possibility that the transition to the age of information, with its new technologies for rec@@ ord@@ ing, dis@@ sem@@ in@@ ating and re@@ produc@@ ing information, could result in the development of new forms of m@@ ass ill@@ iter@@ acy.
The Commission has a responsibil@@ ity, but protecting the environment is not sufficiently high on its agenda.
By treating benefici@@ aries of international protection equally in all Member States, such a measure pu@@ ts an end to the inequalities which have hitherto existed between Member States and will allow the individuals in question to resid@@ e in a Member State other than the one in which they g@@ ain@@ ed legal recogni@@ tion, something which did not happen pre@@ vi@@ ously.
We will therefore move forward on this issue, believe me.
G@@ i@@ ven that legislative excell@@ ence is a priority for Parliament, I would emphasise the importance of providing the Members, committees and political groups with the necessary means to achieve this objec@@ tive, along with the means to cover their overall needs in relation to the long-term build@@ ings policy.
Direc@@ t marke@@ ting is possible over the Interne@@ t if the consumer has given per@@ mission for it in adv@@ ance.
These are things that will really mean something to all consumers and us@@ ers of electron@@ ic communication services.
There is one thing we need to bear in mind@@ : if necessary, we could also import foo@@ d, but not in a way that meets our condi@@ tions.
These inclu@@ ded, in particular, a commissioner for justice and fundamental rights, and a commissioner for action in the field of climate change@@ , and, of course, I now need compe@@ t@@ ent men and women who are committed to Europe, who can successfully complete their respec@@ tive tas@@ ks under the various port@@ fo@@ li@@ os, which will cor@@ respon@@ d to the priorities for European Union action.
E@@ speci@@ ally where documents of third parties are concerned, for example documents of Member States or of external organisations, things could be arran@@ ged more effec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y.
If the production of al@@ co@@ ho@@ l by German far@@ mer@@ s, under the rules of the mon@@ o@@ po@@ ly, including federal pay@@ ments, is necessary for the main@@ ten@@ ance of preci@@ ous eco-@@ systems or to cover the additional costs of environ@@ ment@@ all@@ y-@@ friend@@ ly production metho@@ d@@ s, there would be no problems, as current state aid rules offer substantial possi@@ bili@@ ties for Member States to gr@@ ant aid for those pur@@ pos@@ es.
W@@ ays of dealing with waste should be not only accep@@ table to societ@@ y, but also in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic@@ ally safe@@ .
In my opini@@ on, it would have been more appropriate to del@@ ay the decision on accession until the Commission has presented its next progress report.
It has already been said here that it is quite difficult to say what a large number actually mean@@ s: a large number where there are a lot of people, or a large number whe@@ re, for example, there are 20 kil@@ om@@ et@@ res of be@@ ach per in@@ ha@@ bit@@ ant and public right of acc@@ ess@@ ?
It is therefore necessary and ex@@ pe@@ di@@ ent to review the framework agreement that govern@@ s relations between Parliament and the Commission.
We must not now allow it to be punished for its own effici@@ ency.
By fo@@ il@@ ing the activities of ‘@@ Women on W@@ av@@ es’ which aims to provide information, the Portuguese Government has not given evid@@ ence of having taken this Hou@@ se@@ ’s resolution seriously.
Palestini@@ ans will have to re@@ build large parts of their administration without which daily life cannot function in an order@@ ly fas@@ hi@@ on.
I have to say that it is rather disappoin@@ ting that the two opini@@ ons from the committees have been large@@ ly ig@@ no@@ red in the Committee of Citizens' Freedom@@ s.
What we need to do is debate proposals to improve, streng@@ then and clari@@ fy its application and improve the degree of compliance with the framework l@@ aid down in the current Treaty and provided for, amongst other things, in the Stability and Growth Pact.
Many governments need to think whether they want to risk being shown by us as a Parliament to be clearly ho@@ sti@@ le to the consumer if they take this line in the Council.
This is the only solution, there is no other.
This report needs to provide a solution whereby Cap@@ e Ver@@ de would be e@@ ligi@@ ble for programmes under the scope of the European neighbour@@ hood policy.
A@@ wa@@ ren@@ ess@@ -@@ ra@@ ising is the first step.
With the cor@@ rec@@ t mar@@ k@@ ings and label@@ s, consumers will know exactly what they are ge@@ tt@@ ing, and will be able to make their cho@@ ice on the basis of criteria such as energy efficiency and the low@@ est environmental co@@ st.
L@@ ast No@@ v@@ em@@ ber, the Commission tabled a proposal for an anti-@@ racism directive.
On the contrary, trade policy and agricultural policy can and must be mutually sup@@ por@@ tive.
There are two conditions for that. The first is that F@@ au@@ re@@  @@ G@@ n@@ ass@@ ing@@ b@@ é must withdraw immedi@@ ately and without argument and put an end to this he@@ red@@ itary dic@@ t@@ ator@@ ship that he sought to in@@ st@@ all by military in de@@ fi@@ ance of democratic principles and the law@@ s of his country and in violation of international law.
Lastly, Parliament asks to be associated with the As@@ soci@@ ation Council@@ s and their sub@@ committees on human rights and hopes that its inter@@ parliamentary deleg@@ ations can play an enh@@ anced role in that respect, by regularly including debates on the democracy clause on their meeting agend@@ as.
I support the budget committee proposal for meet@@ ings to be organised with national parliaments with the aim of discussing the out@@ lines of EU and Member State budgets for 201@@ 2.
I have been disappoin@@ ted by some aspects of the report@@ 's focus@@ .
Some people claim that the financial markets do not valu@@ e the euro because of Europe@@ ' s tar@@ d@@ in@@ ess in implementing structural reform@@ s.
Mr President, the Common Fisheries Polic@@ y has done so much damage to fishing commun@@ ities, f@@ ish stocks and the wi@@ der environment within our own wat@@ ers it is inc@@ ap@@ able of mean@@ ing@@ ful reform and should be sc@@ rap@@ p@@ ed wh@@ ol@@ es@@ al@@ e.
I voted in favour of the report by Mr Wo@@ j@@ ci@@ ec@@ ho@@ w@@ sk@@ i which, through a ser@@ ies of interesting amendments to the Commission's tex@@ t, see@@ ks to up@@ date and make more flexible a d@@ ated pi@@ ece of legislation that is no longer in step with cont@@ ing@@ ent nee@@ d@@ s.
Be@@ yond the stric@@ t rules for ad@@ minister@@ ing migr@@ atory flows, there are equally ele@@ ment@@ ary rules concerning respect for individual rights.
Go@@ o@@ d@@ will abroad no@@ t@@ with@@ stand@@ ing, children from those de@@ vast@@ ated communities should not be re@@ moved from the socie@@ ties and tradi@@ tions that they know@@ .
Thir@@ d, the European Union Member States need a clear ex@@ it strateg@@ y.
The meeting conven@@ ed on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day, 1@@  December, involving MEP@@ s, certain committees and other EU institutions involved in the summit@@ , specifically to discuss human rights concerns in Tunisi@@ a, further highligh@@ ted the importance of these issues.
S@@ ince, fur@@ thermore, they are subject to enti@@ rely sum@@ mar@@ y tri@@ als, I believe it is urgent that you inter@@ ven@@ e so that the situation and conditions being experienced by the accus@@ ed may impro@@ ve.
Secondly, I want to stress the need to be careful not to damage our European institutions by b@@ lowing up into a major s@@ can@@ d@@ al matters which are important in relation to Eurostat but which, bearing in mind the prospec@@ tive elections, might do un@@ to@@ ld damage to our institutions if pursu@@ ed too strong@@ ly.
Common defini@@ tions, methods and standards in the area of combating illegal immigration are a s@@ ine qu@@ a n@@ on in the process of creating a common European policy on migration.
That someone should argu@@ e against that is something that I find ut@@ ter@@ ly b@@ aff@@ l@@ ing.
W@@ r@@ itten declar@@ ations (@@ Rule 14@@ 2)
Now that we are members of the EU, though, we have to see that we put people before prof@@ its, that pers@@ ons come before directives.
For the mom@@ ent, any over@@ ly broad definition of the uni@@ versal service would involve unacceptably high costs that would sti@@ f@@ le competition.
Furthermore, a lot of deb@@ r@@ is of all kinds has been depos@@ ited in ri@@ ver@@ s, stre@@ am@@ s and other water@@ cour@@ ses.
Such a proposal revolu@@ tion@@ is@@ es the application of national and European criminal law and therefore deserves a well considered and transparent decision-making process, prec@@ eded by a proper public debate.
At the same time, ar@@ tic@@ les in the Greek press report that the Greek Fin@@ ance Ministry is to undertake another review of the 3@@ r@@ d C@@ S@@ F@@ , which is to be approved by the Commission.
I should like to thank Parliament for the support we have ob@@ ta@@ ined over recent years, for the good cooperation that I have always enjo@@ y@@ ed from you, the representatives of the citizens of the European Union.
What proposals will you bring us for the budget in the future?
There is also a proposal to regul@@ ate the collec@@ tion of statis@@ tical data on plant protection products.
The more complex s@@ ci@@ enti@@ fic and technical developments becom@@ e, the more important it is to explain the consequences of new technolo@@ gy to the public and to assist MEPs in their decision-making with the aid of S@@ T@@ O@@ A.
An@@ y@@ one now wishing to modi@@ fy the agricultural policy must be quite clear that three sets of demands will be awa@@ ken@@ ed.
If the international community wishes to ensure a certain degree of cohe@@ ren@@ ce, if no results emer@@ ge from the two initiatives, it will be difficult to act as if there were nothing else to be don@@ e, and at that point the international community, whether this be the UN or other institutions, ought to focus on slightly different mean@@ s.
Now - during this presidency - is your golden opportunity to take initiati@@ ves.
That is how we su@@ stain our considerable lead in world marke@@ ts.
H@@ a@@ ving said that, it must also be remem@@ be@@ red that funding is not everything and that there are other measures that these organizations have been awa@@ iting for some time, such as increased access to information and easier access to the cour@@ ts.
(A@@ p@@ pl@@ aus@@ e@@ )
We therefore need to step up our efforts to make sm@@ al@@ ler towns more at@@ trac@@ tive, so that, for example, v@@ ill@@ ages are not deser@@ ted in favour of citi@@ es, as this can have neg@@ ative re@@ per@@ cus@@ sions on the rural economy of some Member States.
We need ports that can ac@@ commo@@ date ships in dist@@ res@@ s, but if those ports are to allow ships to ent@@ er, we need compensation arrange@@ ments.
Y@@ es, the Member States and MEPs are propor@@ tion@@ ately repres@@ en@@ ted, although exact numbers will need to be discussed in due cour@@ se.
I also hope that we have made a little progress towards more transparency.
The Eurostat affair does nothing to further that caus@@ e.
They will meet priv@@ ately behind clo@@ sed do@@ or@@ s and ap@@ point the president who@@ m we shall send to the US and Latin America.
Secondly, there is no point announ@@ cing and public@@ iz@@ ing a right if the exercise of that right is ham@@ pe@@ red by a lack of resources, both material and im@@ materi@@ al.
In this regard, I would like to thank Mr Al@@ v@@ ar@@ o for his excellent work.
This is a positive sign@@ al that we applaud but they are meeting to coordinate different strugg@@ les and not to mi@@ x up the internal and external strugg@@ les.
This is a dangerous p@@ ath and could create dangerous di@@ visi@@ ons.
The Commission will include the European Parliament's proposal in its preparation of the mechanism for the E@@ L@@ IS initiative, an initiative which also supports the creation of jobs by small companies via a lo@@ an guarantee system.
It makes no reference to Mr W@@ ise lea@@ ving the IND/DEM Group and I won@@ dered whether this was a mis@@ take@@ .
It re@@ ve@@ als the need for the European Union to take defin@@ ite steps in order to ensure that it does not la@@ g even further behind Jap@@ an and the USA in these countries, but star@@ ts to cat@@ ch up with them.
I think that it would have been preferable to leave this to the in@@ coming Commission, which would per@@ haps then have placed a slightly different emphasis in terms of cont@@ ent.
N@@ ever before has the European Union agreed to dedic@@ ate such a significant amount to key energy projec@@ ts.
Rec@@ ent research has shown that the Union is a leader in the field of environmental and non-@@ nuclear energy technology.
It is quite clear and it has been from the very beginning that it was important to secure the period of the last si@@ x months of 200@@ 6@@ , which is outside the next financial peri@@ o@@ d.
The Council wel@@ comes the resolution by the European Parliament of 10 April reinforcing the Union's clear stand against these measures.
I will make a final point. In relation to the Convention, we are in agree@@ ment@@ ; I also welcome the fact that you said it was a joint initiative of Parliament and the Commission.
That is nothing new@@ , but something also included in previous directives.
One of the measures set out in the proposal for a regulation that we are voting on is the creation of a schem@@ e of port state control that would prohibit access by third country vessels involved in illegal fishing activi@@ ties.
In the area of eco-@@ inno@@ v@@ ations, we should like to see more specific initiatives, and we are pleased to note that, fin@@ ally, industrial policy linked to innovation and aid for small and medium-sized enter@@ prises has been included in the Commission’s program@@ me.
It is fair to say that the US is our natural ally and, for that reason, I would dispute the statement made here this ev@@ en@@ ing that the world is less secure as a result of American policy rather than more sec@@ ure.
However, I see that the rapporteur h@@ im@@ self, Mr Po@@ s@@ sel@@ t, is asking for the flo@@ or@@ .
To put it blun@@ tly, the Commission expec@@ ts the policy of non-@@ cooperation to end.
We do not accept the claim that the hy@@ d@@ ro@@ logical plan is purely a Spanish aff@@ air@@ , not just because the Spanish government wants EUR 8 billion from the Structural Funds to be spent on financing part of it but because, if it were to be imple@@ men@@ ted, it would viol@@ ate European legislation on nature conservation and the safe@@ guar@@ ding of water resources and would lead to a dis@@ tor@@ tion of competition in the agricultural sector.
We must be clear in what we say and as far as I am concerned, the Council should consider taking the same measures as we have done in Zimbab@@ we, namely den@@ y F@@ ide@@ l Ca@@ str@@ o access to the European Union, as, in fact, Greece has done in the con@@ text of the Olympic G@@ am@@ es.
Without wishing to lum@@ p everything together hy@@ ster@@ ic@@ ally, because each period is differen@@ t, we have failed to learn the lessons of histor@@ y.
Indeed, it is easy to affir@@ m principles, but we still need to make sure that the results and consequences of implementing them do not help to make the situation even worse.
R@@ educ@@ ing the V@@ A@@ T rate for labour-intensive services meets this objective.
However, we also believe our committee has improved the text by bringing it closer to reality and by clari@@ fying certain aspects of it.
That is the type of message we have to get ac@@ ros@@ s.
E@@ qu@@ ally, we must remember that we need to be sensi@@ ble@@ .
In addition, among the problems faced by European cohesion policy at the beginning of the 21@@ st century, are issues that are external in charac@@ ter, such as, for example, the growing development differen@@ ces between the European Union and the US@@ A.
That would place un@@ reasonable demands upon the local author@@ ities, which would then also have to take s@@ am@@ ples in connection with various sport@@ s, which might also have much longer seas@@ ons than the actual b@@ a@@ thing seas@@ on.
I come from a country that experienced the h@@ ard@@ est commun@@ ism in Europe, where human rights were not very high on its lead@@ ers' agenda.
F@@ emale poverty is not only the result of the recent economic crisis, but also the consequence of a variety of factors such as ste@@ reo@@ typ@@ ing, the gender pay gap@@ , the obstacles created by the f@@ ail@@ ure to reconcile family life and work, the longer life expect@@ ancy of women and, more gener@@ ally, the various forms of gender discrimination, which mo@@ st@@ ly affect women.
H@@ as it taken us further down the road towards closer and closer union between the n@@ ations of Europe@@ ?
It does not speci@@ fy how many of them occur@@ red in Europe because there have been very fe@@ w, mainly in countries which were not members of the European Union at the time of the accid@@ ent.
Just as the ref@@ us@@ al to set legal frame@@ works for all possible forms of relation@@ ships between human beings could not be compared to any type of discrimination.
The whole event show@@ ed me that there is a great interest in European cinem@@ a, in sp@@ ite of the fact that our promotion of cinem@@ a production is we@@ a@@ ker than that of American mo@@ vi@@ es.
We must create both support and a structure for democratic development throughout the M@@ id@@ d@@ le E@@ ast.
Madam President, I would like, with reference to this report, to under@@ line the problem of transl@@ ation: reference should be made to the French or Italian versi@@ on, since the text adopted by this Parliament will also be the author@@ it@@ ative one for the Commission.
(ES) Madam President, I would like to express my support and acknowle@@ dgement of the work that some of our fellow Members have been doing for a long time with regard to Ethiopia and in particular that of our fri@@ end and colleague An@@ a G@@ om@@ es, not just because of the mission that took place, but because over all these years she has been condemning the situation in Ethiopia and taking it extremely seriously.
When exactly we en@@ ter good times is a countr@@ y-@@ b@@ y-@@ country assessment.
The '@@ Women in Agric@@ ul@@ ture@@ ' report was bac@@ ked by a significant majority of MEPs and is a time@@ ly measure.
I agree with the resolution@@ 's call for the Commission and the Member States to develop an ambiti@@ ous, eco-@@ efficient and green EU industrial strategy in order to rec@@ re@@ ate manufac@@ turing capacity across the EU territory and to gener@@ ate highly qualified and well paid jobs within the EU.
Europe will only be a credi@@ ble part@@ ne@@ r in negotiations if it pres@@ ents realis@@ tic@@ , achiev@@ able and comm@@ on-@@ sense propos@@ als, which will be a starting point for reaching international consensus and understanding.
What is the tru@@ th@@ ?
It consid@@ ers that direct efforts are needed in effective cooperation and commun@@ ic@@ ation, mainly between central and regional level, where we consider that there are problems, as well as in the consolidation and comple@@ tion of institutional struc@@ tures at both central and regional level.
Re@@ member@@ ing the victims of to@@ tal@@ itari@@ an@@ ism in Europe, I am grateful to all those who have contributed to the European democratic movement.
The releas@@ e of stocks has improved the sup@@ ply situation and had a cal@@ ming effect on the market and on prices.
Li@@ ke@@ w@@ ise, we cannot simply record the rise in xenopho@@ b@@ ic feelings in Europe and the increasingly common discrimination without taking wide-ranging action.
Every uni@@ fied regulation in Europe is better than the current pat@@ ch@@ work qu@@ il@@ t arrange@@ ment.

We must not l@@ ay ourselves open to the accus@@ ation that we are eng@@ aging in economic@@ s for the benefit of special interest groups.
The ecopoint system should therefore apply on@@ ly, as was originally inten@@ ded, to transi@@ t through the Al@@ ps and not also to jour@@ ne@@ ys in the rest of Au@@ stri@@ a@@ ; the alternative would be that the ecopoint system would constitu@@ te an ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ary measu@@ re, and other Member States would be able to claim the right to im@@ pose their ow@@ n.
With these considerations in min@@ d, I agree with the rapporteur when she calls for a substantial increase in funding for humanitarian aid and when she obser@@ ves that the Con@@ s@@ ensus on humanitarian aid is not sufficiently known.
The draft Treaty drawn up by the Convention is the result of more than just intergovernmental negotiation.
Greece and Ireland will event@@ u@@ ally default on their deb@@ ts, and we will all be shown to have thro@@ wn good money after b@@ ad@@ .
Wh@@ y not bu@@ y gas on the Ukra@@ ini@@ an@@ -@@ Russian border?
They happen un@@ expec@@ te@@ d@@ ly.
(FR) Mr President, like all my colleagues I voted for Mrs R@@ ou@@ re@@ 's report on combating racism and xenopho@@ bi@@ a by means of criminal law.
Mr President, no one on the temporary committee will ever forget the af@@ ter@@ mat@@ h of that great foo@@ t and mouth pl@@ agu@@ e of 2001@@ .
The E@@ r@@ as@@ mus m@@ un@@ du@@ s programme is fin@@ ally going to try to overcome these obstac@@ les, contribu@@ ting to the development of quality education and al@@ lowing freedom of movement within the European area.
in writing. - President, I abstain@@ ed on this report as I believe the UN is in urgent need of review and reform@@ .
I would like to offer my hear@@ t@@ fel@@ t thanks to all concerned for the difficult, but ultimately produc@@ tive, work undertaken within the Conciliation Committe@@ e.
It is important to establish that the negotiations are under way and that both sid@@ es need to contribute construc@@ tively to th@@ es@@ e.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have hear@@ d, the United N@@ ations have requested and called on the European Union to make a contribution to the elections in Con@@ go by sending a military missi@@ on.
The sel@@ ling off of plant would appear to indicate the oppos@@ ite@@ ; it is the wrong message to send when you are trying to pl@@ u@@ g a financial ho@@ le.
The E@@ G@@ F was set up in 200@@ 6 to provide practical support to workers made redundant either for reas@@ ons associated with the reloc@@ ation of their companies or, following the 200@@ 9 amend@@ ment, on account of the economic crisis, in order to assist their re@@ integration into the labour market.
How much more could this Parliament have done to demon@@ strate that European decision-making in food safety was in a mess@@ ?
That is the b@@ ig@@ g@@ est ever death tol@@ l among journalists in the world.
This is the report I myself dra@@ f@@ ted, which was voted on during the last part-@@ session in April 201@@ 1.
The fundamental go@@ al of the proposal is to establish b@@ in@@ ding legislation, the only solution that off@@ ers guarantees that political and industrial commitments to continu@@ ously improve nuclear safety are follow@@ ed by concrete measures.
L@@ est there be any doubt I would add that employment in Belgium is being ru@@ ined by a Soci@@ al@@ -@@ Christian Democrat government which does nothing but think up new tax@@ es and le@@ vi@@ es and which has already succe@@ eded in pushing up gross w@@ age costs to the highest level in the European Union.
This Euro@@ -@@ Mediterranean partnership is all the more important at a time when the Union is en@@ lar@@ ging into Central and Eastern Europe and will be focus@@ ing the li@@ on's share of its financial resources there.
I know that he consulted many other parliamentary committees in order to product a well balanced text and we ourselves had the ple@@ asu@@ re of discussing the subject with him on several occasions.
If we cannot reach an agreement between the 2@@ 7 Member States of the EU, how can we hope to find common ground between the 3@@ 9 countries in the EP@@ C@@ ?
We do not want to open the floo@@ d@@ g@@ ates and have hund@@ re@@ ds of amendments re@@ writing l@@ eng@@ thy resolutions by a committee of 7@@ 00@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ something Members, but on the other h@@ and a limited right of amendment where there is a strong wish for it, we fel@@ t, was a reasonable compromise and a right balance.
Mer@@ cur@@ y has also been used success@@ ful@@ ly, and without major health implic@@ ations, in d@@ enti@@ stry in the form of am@@ al@@ g@@ am f@@ ill@@ ings.
Since the military offen@@ sive by the U@@ gan@@ d@@ an Government, in just over a year, it is estimated that 5 000 children have been ab@@ duc@@ ted.
The situation is now exactly the same a year l@@ ater@@ .
For that reason, European cooperation is needed.
We hope that the Lisbon Treaty will soon come into force and we are delighted with the European Parliament's support for the preparatory actions in the field of sport@@ , which contribute to implementation of the new EU compe@@ tence in this area.
The reform allows a relatively long transitional period because the partly cou@@ ple@@ d aid can run until 2009@@ .
It includes the powerful incentive for reform and the contribution the process makes to stability and prosper@@ ity, the example that it sets to the world that there is no contradiction between Is@@ la@@ m and democracy, human rights and the protection of fundamental freedom@@ s, and its contribution to reducing ten@@ sion in the A@@ e@@ ge@@ an and over C@@ y@@ pr@@ us.
This is an approach that o@@ thers have also ad@@ voc@@ ated he@@ re.
We are drawing up a declar@@ ation, to en@@ comp@@ ass the entire range of transatlantic cooperation.
P@@ l@@ ati@@ tudes ten@@ d to re@@ b@@ ound p@@ ain@@ fully on those who mouth them.
In our view@@ , the economic governance package - at least in its present form - is the wrong answer to the crisis with which we are deal@@ ing.
Vic@@ e-@@ President of the Commission. - Mr President, the debate about lob@@ b@@ ying is always interesting and exc@@ it@@ ing.
At an oper@@ ational level, the Presidency feels that this summit needs to establish a forwar@@ d-@@ loo@@ king, powerful system cap@@ able of taking on the challenge of the current food crisis and increasing efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
This is why the proposals to improve the living conditions of women in rural areas, b@@ y, for example, creating education and training infrastruc@@ tures at all level@@ s, promoting equal access to the labour marke@@ t, providing incentives to encourage women's ent@@ re@@ pre@@ ne@@ ur@@ ship and developing high-@@ quality social and health services, are essential for sustainable rural development.
We need these countries to work together with us to stop mul@@ t@@ in@@ ational crime.
Mr President, the main conclusion to be drawn is that, in 10 years of Structural Funds, no real progress has been made in clo@@ sing the h@@ u@@ ge gap between the per capita income of the rich@@ est and the po@@ o@@ rest regions of the European Union.
Re@@ gre@@ t@@ tab@@ ly, des@@ p@@ ite the fin@@ e words, the United States is pl@@ aying along with the ha@@ w@@ k@@ s, the Is@@ ra@@ el@@ i extremists and the M@@ us@@ li@@ m fundament@@ alists, while Europe, by which I mean the main European States, have remained sil@@ ent throughout this time.
As regards the secretari@@ al al@@ low@@ an@@ ce, if we are to improve it, it is essential we have in place an assist@@ an@@ t@@ 's stat@@ ute@@ .
I have voted against the report, which was n@@ one@@ the@@ less adopted by 3@@ 4@@ 5 votes, with 10@@ 2 vo@@ tes against and 34 ab@@ sten@@ tions.
The proposals l@@ ater this year on rare diseas@@ es will also help to improve, in@@ ter alia, the situation regarding rare typ@@ es of can@@ cer@@ .
En@@ c@@ ouraging Turkish in@@ transi@@ g@@ ence certainly does not help to bring the two communities closer together in the in@@ timate talks under the ae@@ g@@ is of the UN Secre@@ tary Gener@@ al.
The In@@ no@@ vation Union initiative is very important and is, at the present time, the most concrete attempt at an inte@@ gra@@ ted European innovation policy.
The issue of Ukraine and the European Union being sup@@ pli@@ ed gas by Russia must be resol@@ ved as quick@@ ly as possible.
Mr E@@ is@@ ma@@ , I must ask you to take that up in writing with the Bu@@ re@@ au@@ , because it has nothing to do with the R@@ ul@@ es of Pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re.
We also wish to question the allocation of this money to a single international fun@@ d.
Ou@@ t of the 1@@ 8 ag@@ g@@ l@@ om@@ er@@ ations dischar@@ ging into those areas, 1@@ 4 comply with the requirements of the directive.
In this specific case, there is much, however, to indicate that the European Union is not yet ready to take that step.
With Mr Gra@@ y as chi@@ ef account@@ ant and Mr O@@ o@@ sten@@ s as direc@@ tor of the accountancy di@@ vision, we shall have two qualified and experienced account@@ ants and qualified managers at the he@@ ad of this ambitious project which, if it is successful - and I am con@@ fi@@ d@@ ent that it will be - will put the EU administration at the fo@@ ref@@ ront of moder@@ n public administration in accountancy as it is in other areas.
The Council, with a view to budge@@ tary restric@@ tion, dec@@ reas@@ ed that allocation in its proposal and set it at EUR 11@@ 2.@@ 5 million per year.
Again, we have conflict, contradiction and dual standards.
Food safety is of course the y@@ ard@@ s@@ tic@@ k in this area.
The time has come to pay greater attention to Europe's peop@@ les, to human be@@ ings, and less to num@@ ber@@ s.
Y@@ oung people are the largest group among the un@@ employe@@ d.
The text we have adopted will be revised in four year@@ s' time.
It appears almost as though the ulti@@ mate objective is that tra@@ p@@ ping should not take place in Europe.
This is not an ab@@ str@@ act state@@ ment.
Let us use the opportunity to show Europe@@ ans that the European Union is looking a@@ head@@ , sha@@ ping its policies to meet tomorrow@@ 's challenges and equip@@ ping itself with the right tool@@ s.
The only thing is coordin@@ ation, but for example UN@@ H@@ CR has a special mandate and we have to be careful not to leave them margin@@ alised.
In the future, con@@ jo@@ ining the two will be very important in maintaining competition and conser@@ ving the environment.
At the end of the procedure, they also ques@@ tioned the legitim@@ acy of the request made by the government of U@@ p@@ per B@@ av@@ ari@@ a and inv@@ ited it to initi@@ ate the safe@@ gu@@ ard clause procedure pursu@@ ant to the a@@ fores@@ aid directive if it continued to have doub@@ ts.
All of the countries mentioned requested assistance from the fund after they were struck and par@@ aly@@ se@@ d, in the spring and sum@@ mer months of last year, by lan@@ d@@ s@@ lid@@ es, flo@@ od wa@@ ves and almost continu@@ ous ra@@ inf@@ all.
We need to have clear criteria during the planning stage to prevent any country from being pen@@ alised because it is precisely at the planning stage when in@@ adequate and in@@ effective alloc@@ ations are made, which sub@@ sequ@@ ently have an impact on citizens' quality of li@@ fe@@ .
(PL) Mr President, the Europe 2020 strategy we are discussing ha@@ s, above all, an ide@@ o@@ logical dimen@@ sion.
The speeding up of the process is therefore an important issue which has been taken up by Mrs Lam@@ ber@@ t.
At present, all the institutions issue their guidelines in the spr@@ ing, and the hope now exists that the Commission will also base its draft budget on ideas from the Council and Parliament.
We must ensure that we work cons@@ ist@@ ently towards that end.
They are increasingly cho@@ o@@ sing win@@ es from C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a, Ch@@ ile or South Africa in pre@@ ference to our Mor@@ avi@@ an, Cz@@ ech@@ , French or Italian win@@ es.
In our conclusion we dis@@ co@@ vered that there is s@@ cep@@ ticism about the result of the presidential election.
The elections at the end of this month will take place under difficult condi@@ tions, but we must hope that they will create the conditions needed for a democratic and so@@ ve@@ reign Ira@@ q to make a new star@@ t.
I shall give the example of Fin@@ l@@ and, whose representatives have played a very active role in the Con@@ ven@@ tion: 5@@ 3% of the public is in favour and 3@@ 7@@ % again@@ st.
In the 199@@ 7 budget we focus@@ ed on maintaining our commitments under the inter@@ -@@ institutional agree@@ ment, which we did not wish to see disappear then, n@@ or do we wish to see it disappear during this budget procedu@@ re.
The neglec@@ t of intern@@ ation@@ ally agreed nuclear safety standards should be open@@ ly and firmly condem@@ ne@@ d.
We are r@@ un@@ ning over the al@@ lo@@ t@@ ted time.
The man@@ i@@ p@@ ulation of gen@@ es results in spec@@ ies and varie@@ ties which do not occur natur@@ ally.
I regret that the draft Constitution does not in any way change the situation and allows complete independence to continue without bal@@ anc@@ ing the objectives of price stability and employment.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at the previous plenary session of the European Parliament, a debate was held on the steps to take in the fight against terrorism in the wake of the attacks of 11 Septem@@ ber.
I said to Parliament that I set a deadline of Christ@@ m@@ as to resolve this situation.
The har@@ b@@ our construction project is receiving support from the Structural Funds and chi@@ ef@@ ly involves d@@ red@@ ging the ri@@ ver Bo@@ y@@ ne E@@ stu@@ ary and depos@@ iting the mu@@ d on the mu@@ d@@ fl@@ ats at Ste@@ g@@ ren@@ nan@@ .
As far as guarantee th@@ res@@ hol@@ ds are concerned, the Commission proposal is that they should gra@@ du@@ ally be reduc@@ ed by 2.@@ 6@@ % to 3@@ 34 000 tonnes by 2004.
This is the only language that the Sud@@ anese Government understand@@ s.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in relation to the annual report (@@ 2007@@ ) on the main aspects and basic choices of the common foreign and security policy, I would like to emphasise some of the important issues from the viewpoint of the Committee on Budge@@ ts.
It is a terrible phenomen@@ on whose scale is un@@ known.
on behalf of the UE@@ N Group. - (PL) Mr President, for some time now we have been aware of the Russian company Gaz@@ prom@@ 's worr@@ ying pen@@ ch@@ ant for collec@@ ting for@@ mer leaders of European Union countries.
Croatia will be a member of the European Union in a few years and, therefore, for this period up to the time when Croatia is able to join the Schengen arrange@@ ment, as a member of the European Union, we will have the arrange@@ ment to which the honourable Member refer@@ red.
No@@ w, these seven dign@@ it@@ aries of the B@@ ah@@ á@@ '@@ í religious community are to be subjec@@ ted to a tri@@ al this week that meets not even the most basic requirements of the rule of law.
Firstly, we must force@@ fully re@@ iter@@ ate our condemnation of all extre@@ m@@ ist@@ s: the J@@ e@@ wish extremists and their ac@@ compl@@ ic@@ es, who murdered Y@@ it@@ z@@ ha@@ k R@@ ab@@ in@@ ; and the f@@ an@@ atic@@ s of Hamas and H@@ iz@@ b@@ ol@@ la@@ h and their foreign sponsor@@ s - no@@ tably Iran - who have already committe@@ d, or are ready to commit@@ , ap@@ p@@ alling attacks against innocent civilians.
Community assistance under the I@@ gn@@ al@@ ina programme is de@@ li@@ vered in two ways. The first is directly to the benefici@@ ary country using a mechanism based on one of the European Community@@ ’s pre@@ -@@ accession financial instruments, P@@ H@@ A@@ RE@@ .
The situation is coming to a head@@ .
W@@ ill you ensure that they are carried out on all nuclear plants, including waste and re@@ process@@ ing facilities, because I have a particular concern about Sel@@ la@@ fiel@@ d, which is close to the Irish border?
the report by Mrs Ma@@ thi@@ eu@@ , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Centre for the Development of Vo@@ c@@ ational T@@ ra@@ ining for the financial year 200@@ 8 (SEC(@@ 2009@@ )@@ 108@@ 9 - C@@ 7@@ -01@@ 8@@ 1@@ /200@@ 9 -@@ ,
The Commission also accep@@ ts that a report@@ ing oblig@@ ation has been included in the draft regulation on the applic@@ ation.
The second has to do with the question as to how we should apply the I@@ FR@@ S standards in future, an aspect that will become more and more important.
Although unfortunately we still do not have codecision, I hope that on this occ@@ a@@ sion the work done and the opinion of Parliament will be taken into accoun@@ t.
In this way, the Union can help to enh@@ ance the competi@@ tiveness of the tour@@ ism industry, which is a significant economic fac@@ tor and an even more significant source of employment.
Mr President, in order to avoid any possible con@@ fu@@ sion about the vessels which have been the victims of pir@@ acy off the coast of S@@ om@@ alia, I propose to in@@ ser@@ t the words '@@ especially tho@@ se@@ ' after the word '@@ vess@@ el@@ s' in par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h 8.
In particular, we must ensure that young people complete some kind of education and find employment as soon as possible.
Let me suggest one way in which this Parliament could hel@@ p.
First there is the issue of mobil@@ ity, which has already been men@@ tioned.
We simply have to establish that it is still co@@ sting them a great deal of effort in order to build a more power@@ ful@@ , stable democracy.
As regards northern Ira@@ q@@ , the Commission shares the concern expres@@ sed in various draft resolutions about the latest operations by the Turkish Air F@@ or@@ ce and the resulting civilian casual@@ ties.
That is also the reason why we are dealing with it today and why we have no fe@@ wer than seven reports on the subject before us.
We have to understand that millions of people have been radic@@ alised. They have simply said '@@ We have had en@@ ou@@ gh@@ !@@ '@@ .
For these reasons, I was un@@ able to support the Commission's proposal.
We also agree that social exclusion is a complex and multi@@ -@@ fac@@ et@@ ted process, and that it is necessary to st@@ ud@@ y it in greater dep@@ th, particularly as regards its links with pover@@ ty.
From this perspective, we are particularly pleased with the position adopted by the Committee on Industry regarding research into human gen@@ e@@ tic@@ s. T@@ re@@ mend@@ ous progress has been made every@@ where and more is being achieved every day.
These wor@@ th@@ while amendments are the outcome of this@@ ; I think that we will be able to arri@@ ve at a solution to the problem@@ , that is, to reconcile environmental requirements with market and labour require@@ ments.
But that is not how we see the targets in the guidelines and not how we expect the Member States to re@@ act.
It is in these terms that the issue of when to adopt the euro must be conside@@ red.
B@@ es@@ id@@ es the fact that the EU and the United States share a number of common interests and valu@@ es, such as the promotion of peace, democracy, respect for human rights, and the market economy, they have the world's most important bilateral trade and investment relation@@ ship@@ : the transatlantic economy is worth US@@ D 4 2@@ 8@@ 0 billi@@ on.
That is why I am very pleased indeed that we are having this debate today.
The recent execu@@ tion of M@@ s D@@ el@@ ara Dar@@ ab@@ i, han@@ ged on 1 May for a crime she al@@ le@@ ge@@ dly committed when she was a min@@ or, is another confir@@ m@@ ation of this dis@@ m@@ al situation.
Ne@@ w defini@@ tions were needed.
On this poin@@ t, the response is as follow@@ s: the services negotiations and the I@@ M@@ F structural ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ment programmes are not rel@@ ate@@ d.
That is why I will vote against this report.
This proposal addresses all T@@ S@@ E risk in all anim@@ als at all stages of the production cha@@ in.
What are the conditions under which people are work@@ ing@@ ?
I will men@@ tion, though, the form@@ ulation used in Mr Ol@@ s@@ s@@ on's report. H@@ e, too, says '@@ for the fores@@ e@@ eable future@@ ' .
First of all, this is a call for action.
In my country, S@@ p@@ ain, too, a law is being negoti@@ ate@@ d, k@@ no@@ wn as the equality law, which includes making it oblig@@ atory for there to be a balanced presence of men and women on the management bo@@ ards of commer@@ cial compan@@ ies, a balanced presence mean@@ ing that there must be no more than 6@@ 0% of either sex and no less than 4@@ 0@@ %.
The construction industr@@ y has been particularly affected by the current economic situation, and the proposed regulation is inten@@ ded to promote the free@@ , effective and transparent movement of goods and services to the construction industry.
These inclu@@ de@@ : reducing the seats of Parliament to one single loc@@ ation, assess@@ ing expen@@ ses on the basis of the actual costs inc@@ ur@@ red, a top@@ -@@ class anti-fraud system and the real recovery of gr@@ ants that have been improperly paid out, along with the millions to be sa@@ ved by not fo@@ is@@ ting enlarge@@ ments on re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant citizens.
That is why I am so pleased to see Mr Mel@@ ker@@ t here today giving us an over@@ view as to how he se@@ es this debate progres@@ sing during the D@@ ut@@ ch presidency.
I understand that Mad@@ ame G@@ ar@@ aud cannot for the time being undertake that mission for personal reasons, which are fully understand@@ able and have my de@@ ep@@ est sympa@@ th@@ y.
.
Let me conclude by ad@@ ding something on the subject of man@@ d@@ atory insurance, which is meeting with such fi@@ er@@ ce res@@ istan@@ ce, particularly from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrat@@ s.
Mr M@@ c@@ Go@@ w@@ an included that one too.
I think it is important to emphasise that the European Parliament will be involved to the very highest degree in all of these aspects now that we have the Treaty of Lisbon in place, and democratic control will increase in these areas.
If not, then we will proce@@ ed to the vote@@ .
We are also going to discuss innovation in the other part of the European Council.
I am not talking about hard law and regulations, but a way to review each other@@ 's responsibilities.
(ES) Mr President, this Parliament's missi@@ ons to the region of V@@ al@@ en@@ ci@@ a have resul@@ ted from the re@@ ported cas@@ es of town@@ -@@ planning ab@@ us@@ e, which have been reflected in the media and which have been of concern to many citizens.
If we do no@@ thing, H@@ un@@ ting@@ ton@@ ’s Europe w@@ ill@@ , however, come true.
That period will be able to be in@@ terr@@ up@@ ted only on@@ ce, and for a period of twent@@ y day@@ s, for the purpose of obtaining further information when the potential ac@@ qui@@ re@@ r is from another EU Member State@@ , or for thir@@ ty days if from a third country.
As the c@@ lock kee@@ ps tic@@ king, I urge the Commissioner to work with them to find a develop@@ ment@@ -@@ ori@@ ented solution to EP@@ As which ultimately f@@ its in with the needs of the AC@@ P@@ .
One Member was saying that in a similar matter - African h@@ or@@ se sic@@ k@@ ness - her country was left to c@@ ope al@@ one, and that should not be the position either.
   Madam President, first of all I wish to point out that organised religi@@ ons have only been around for some 2@@  @@ 000 years, and we are in danger of ele@@ vating them to a position that they should not ha@@ ve.
I@@ ts purpose is also to complete the simpli@@ fication of procedures on receiving medical c@@ are abroad by extending some of those modi@@ fications to the id@@ en@@ tical procedures regarding benefits for accid@@ ents at work and occ@@ up@@ ational diseases.
It push@@ es the Roma to the margin@@ s of society.
And remem@@ ber, too, that a Europe which guarantees unity in di@@ vers@@ ity contributes not only to stability within its own borders but also to peace throughout the world.
Although the different kinds of violence also v@@ ary across c@@ ultu@@ res and traditions, as already mentioned here, capit@@ alist economic and social crises make women more v@@ ul@@ ner@@ ab@@ le, exac@@ er@@ b@@ ating their exploitation and leading to poverty and margin@@ alisation, which also contributes to trafficking of women and prostitution.
On bio@@ technolog@@ y, I am sure you are at least partly righ@@ t.
However, this document is over-@@ pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tive in its approach and tries to micromanage all areas of external action including setting up an EU In@@ stitu@@ te of Gender Equality without recognising the stri@@ des made by all EU institutions to make every opportunity available to f@@ emale staff@@ .
One must always stress that the great major@@ ity, as I beli@@ e@@ ve, do things by the book.
Mr Po@@ et@@ ter@@ ing and Mr Bar@@ ó@@ n C@@ res@@ po@@ , I he@@ reby confirm the commitment I made to you yester@@ day on behalf of the Commission on the status of European political par@@ ties. The Commission will shoul@@ der its responsibilities.
For the trans-European network@@ s?
How are they to pres@@ er@@ ve their identi@@ ty and community, how can they provide their children with a secure im@@ age of a twent@@ y-@@ first centur@@ y future?
We must be quite clear about that.
Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, after this deb@@ ate, it should be cr@@ y@@ st@@ al clear that the issue of human rights is not just something to talk about on Sund@@ ays while we@@ aring your Sunday bes@@ t.
I think these are ideas worth considering but of course they need to be de@@ e@@ pened and include a specific time@@ table@@ .
I@@ f@@ , therefore, anyone in this House k@@ new about this and did not act in the interests of European tax@@ -@@ pay@@ ers, that is worthy of particular scrutin@@ y.
D@@ uring the procedure, agreement was reached on the stu@@ dies and actions to de@@ vis@@ e, imple@@ ment, comple@@ ment and ass@@ ess the Community measures.
Res@@ um@@ p@@ tion of the session
Every time I see a Corbett report, I think to myself that in reality R@@ ic@@ hard Corbett is to the European Parliament what W@@ orm@@ ton@@ gu@@ e was to K@@ ing Th@@ é@@ o@@ den in L@@ ord of the R@@ ings.
Acc@@ ord@@ ingly, this challenge also rel@@ ates to Member States already in the Schengen area.
No@@ thing else is ho@@ ly if m@@ an is hum@@ ilia@@ ted and depri@@ ved of his rights to live in dign@@ ity.
This has been the most important and positive new aspect of the situation in Africa for many years now, and could allow the whole contin@@ ent to base its ci@@ v@@ il@@ , social and economic development on a so@@ li@@ d, agreed basis.
Finally, I would like to as@@ sure you, Commissioner, of the un@@ condi@@ tional support of Parliament with a broad major@@ ity.
The honourable Member knows that migration and migration flows, especially illegal migration flows, particularly from regions to the s@@ outh of Europe, represent a new problem that we did not have to face just a few years ago.
The Commission can confirm that the appointment of a Portuguese offici@@ al as Direc@@ tor@@ -@@ Gener@@ al for P@@ ress and Communication was firmly based on the principles that were set out by the Pro@@ d@@ i Commission when we took office in 1999, and specifically those principles which require that mer@@ it is the prime consideration in taking appointment decisions and that every effort should be made cons@@ istent with the provisions of the staff regulations, to respect the need for a balance of national@@ ities in sen@@ i@@ or management positions.
But what is the future to be@@ ?
The previous legislation, which did not allow a citizen of a third country with a long-@@ st@@ ay vis@@ a granted by a Member State to tra@@ vel to other Member States, did not meet the mobility needs of the majority of those citizens.
And I won@@ der whether you really believe that you can get this issue, in which Parliament has also been involved since Am@@ ster@@ d@@ am in terms of codecision, appro@@ ved.
I must, therefore, congratulate you for the very cooper@@ ative way in which your Members and the Council, and in particular the Irish presidency, have work@@ ed with us to reach a solution.
There are also reports that speak of some Taliban military success@@ es and of a return to what pass@@ es for a sort of g@@ ri@@ m norm@@ ality in K@@ ab@@ ul@@ .
Without adequate resources, n@@ one of these problems will be proper@@ ly dealt with, beginning with the introduc@@ tion of the inter@@ mediate category in cohesion policy, which only makes sense if it does not har@@ m the other categories already in place.
In view of such close economic relations, I am sur@@ pr@@ ised that the EU and Ko@@ re@@ a differ so greatly when it comes to respect for human rights.
That is the problem.
I think it is important that our ACP counter@@ parts should be invol@@ ved.
I have chec@@ ked the Fren@@ ch, Spanish and German versi@@ ons, and the change has already been made in them.
On the second question, he asks me about the acc@@ um@@ ulation of cas@@ e-@@ law and fair tra@@ d@@ ing.
O@@ f course, we all regret the death of the Cuban citizen@@ , Mr Or@@ lan@@ do Z@@ ap@@ ata T@@ ama@@ y@@ o, after a hunger stri@@ ke in a Cuban ho@@ sp@@ it@@ al.
When it comes to the budget item for fisheries reform we have chosen to set up such a budget item but not to alloc@@ ate concrete amounts to it.
That is how the market came into being and it must remain clear that tariffs based on costs al@@ one may de@@ ter invest@@ ments.
Does the Commission expect companies to run two systems, one for internal trans@@ actions and one for extern@@ al, thereby increasing co@@ st@@ s?
If the content of the oblig@@ ations is not un@@ equi@@ voc@@ al, employ@@ ers will have difficulty pro@@ ving that they did comply with the provisions of the law, which may lead to legal dispu@@ tes of un@@ pre@@ dic@@ table out@@ com@@ es.
We consider that the joint committee that will be form@@ ed to over@@ see the agreement is a better solution for ensuring that the agreement is comp@@ li@@ ed with and that it benefits both parties and the environment.
The German b@@ loc@@ k@@ ade ren@@ ders the shift from road to rail im@@ possible.
I would remind the House that yet another f@@ at@@ al accid@@ ent took place last wee@@ k. It happened in the B@@ a@@ reg@@ g tun@@ nel in S@@ w@@ it@@ zer@@ lan@@ d.
Ques@@ tions to Commissioner Fisch@@ ler
Mr President, I would first of all like to thank the President, Mr Pro@@ v@@ an, for his kind words, but particularly for the way in which he@@ , together with Mr R@@ o@@ car@@ d, has pre@@ si@@ ded over and gu@@ ided the entire process.
In the case of the feed ban@@ , implementation includes regular mic@@ ros@@ c@@ op@@ ic examination of feed@@ stu@@ ff@@ s and inspection of feed@@ stuff plan@@ ts.
We in Parliament at least have come to know Mrs A@@ sh@@ ton as an excellent lead@@ er.
The Commission must work in N@@ ep@@ al through all stages of the conflict, from suppl@@ ying humanitarian aid for those suff@@ ering, to ensuring that conflict resolution and prevention programmes are launched to prevent further violence.
Mr President, I will try to live up to that reques@@ t.
(@@ RO@@ ) In my capacity as vic@@ e-@@ president of E@@ N@@ V@@ I, I would like to make several remar@@ ks concerning the impact of climate change on agric@@ ulture.
Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur.
I therefore voted against this proposal.
It is actually rather strange that this is being said so blun@@ tly here, because this is not how it is being done in D@@ en@@ mar@@ k.
This is the only way to reach a permanent solution, and the only way in which we can hope to cooper@@ ate successfully with Turkey - which is, after all, a European country.
The debate is closed.
(@@ Parliament adopted the resolution@@ )
What was different with Kosovo and Serbia was the unanim@@ ity of one group, 9@@ 8@@ % of Kosov@@ ars, and in particular the international decisi@@ on.
These doub@@ ts arise because of the plans to develop the Rus@@ so-@@ German gas pi@@ pe@@ line across the whole of the Baltic Se@@ a.
L@@ et, then, the new service concep@@ ts come about in a commerci@@ ally competitive market where business develop@@ ers sk@@ illed in their field will certainly do their work well.
The scale of the market is too sm@@ all.
P@@ ers@@ on@@ ally, I am con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed that a European promotion mechanism on these lines can en@@ able our original produc@@ tions to compete with those of the American gi@@ ant.
This way, this bl@@ ack ho@@ le in democracy could be f@@ illed and transparency would be a fact of life in legislation at EU level.
W@@ he@@ ther SE@@ M 2000 is a f@@ a@@ ç@@ ade is more a question for the Commissioner, but you also referred to coordination with the national audit bodies.
We are in favour of cooperation between the two sex@@ es and therefore want to see women's concern@@ s, out@@ look and experience making a contribu@@ tion.
L@@ ater on there will also be a lot of vis@@ itor@@ s travel@@ ling from L@@ in@@ z to the other Cap@@ itals of Culture.
I believe that there should be a much clearer provisi@@ on.
EU resources would then be made available to fund key reconstruction activities, such as the re@@ building of basic social infrastruc@@ ture, including heal@@ th, education, water and s@@ an@@ itation services.
The Commission is proposing an average level of appropri@@ ations for commitments of 1.@@ 22% for the period 200@@ 7 – 201@@ 3.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (ES) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my speech by stressing the importance of the strategic energy plan and the necessary contribution it will make to speeding up the development and application of technologies for cle@@ an, sustainable and efficient energy.
The agreement in question brings together very di@@ ver@@ se issues, such as the recognition of crimes per@@ pe@@ tra@@ ted during the col@@ on@@ ial er@@ a, with promises of investment, in ex@@ change for commitments to control migration.
After talks with the European Commission, European mo@@ tor vehic@@ le manufacturer@@ s, repres@@ ented by AC@@ EA@@ , committed themselves in June last year to introduc@@ ing a range of measures starting this year, actually in January 200@@ 2@@ , leading to a high level of pe@@ des@@ tri@@ an protec@@ tion.
However, next month@@ , before we si@@ t again in Stras@@ bourg@@ , the European foo@@ t@@ b@@ all c@@ ham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship star@@ ts.
Let us not make any judg@@ ments before they have been hel@@ d.
But that does not just apply to future Member State@@ s; it also applies to the majority of current Member States.
As the question und@@ en@@ i@@ ably is of more than national signific@@ ance I believe it would be reasonable for the Commission to take an active interest in these issues.
The single market cre@@ ates many problems for disabled people in Europe, problems that Mrs B@@ ano@@ tt@@ i lis@@ ted earli@@ er, and my view is that the dialogue between the European institutions and the disabled people's organizations must be continued or encourage@@ d, particularly with a view to protecting the disabled and enab@@ ling them to enjoy freedom of movement.
It is therefore absolu@@ te@@ ly vital to wi@@ den the scope of this Directive, as proposed by the report, so that, at the very least, f@@ isc@@ al fraud is not so easy. This is in fact a moral im@@ per@@ ative.
(The House ro@@ se and observed a min@@ ute@@ 's sil@@ en@@ ce@@ )
There is a broad agenda of issues that the EU must tackle in Genev@@ a: violence against women, the situation of child@@ ren@@ , tor@@ ture and the death penalty.
The situation would h@@ uge@@ ly improve if the pac@@ ke@@ ts were to dis@@ play the largest possible war@@ ning si@@ gn and if advertising and sponsor@@ ing were b@@ anned al@@ together.
As far as Romania is concerned, which shares a border with Serbi@@ a, this kind of measure can only serve to provide a further guarantee of am@@ ic@@ able cross-border relations.
We also thou@@ ght it would be rather cl@@ um@@ s@@ y of the committee to hold the current Commission responsible for the at@@ ti@@ tudes of previous Commission@@ s.
Ladies and gentlemen, in the previous speech it was mentioned that today the Commission will discuss the proposal to set up an institu@@ te for equal opportunities between men and women, a gender institu@@ te@@ , and I am pleased that we have made progress in this issue.
The figures are, however, cle@@ ar@@ : in recent years, national budgets have increased by 22% while over the same period the Community budget has increased by 9@@ %.
Y@@ et these institutions have other seats and, given that the Community' s actions affect the whole Community territor@@ y, there are in fact thousands of cour@@ ts which could jud@@ ge offici@@ als, Commissioners and so on.
In this respect, I am highly ap@@ preci@@ ative of Commissioner Bar@@ ni@@ er@@ 's strong commitment to take into account citizens' concerns and as@@ pir@@ ations.
However, the pace of negotiations does not depen@@ d on the efforts of the Commission, the Council or the Presidency al@@ on@@ e.
To@@ day almost the whole of Europe lives in freedom and democracy.
We must ensure that these citizens are protected and I believe that Mrs Sch@@ al@@ demo@@ se@@ 's report is an important step in that regar@@ d.
N@@ or does it mean that the special needs of women prison@@ ers should not concern us.
Again, the beef sector@@ , the poultry sector and the pig@@ me@@ at sector will be most affected.
Be@@ fore the vote on b@@ lock 2 by the T@@ ech@@ nical Group of In@@ depend@@ ent Member@@ s:
The e@@ di@@ fic@@ e of representative democracy has remained stead@@ y ever s@@ ince, in the mi@@ d-@@ 19@@ th century, the expansion of suff@@ ra@@ ge made real the promise of the liber@@ al revolu@@ tions to give the people represent@@ ation, so that they could control their own d@@ estini@@ es.
The debate is closed.
This is what makes the circ@@ ulation of U@@ C@@ I@@ T@@ S difficult, because there is mis@@ trust among regul@@ ator@@ s.
The propor@@ tion of women has been particularly low in category A. To remedy this situation, the Commission decided in 199@@ 5 to set annual targets for increasing the number of women in category A and particularly in leading positions.
The Prime Minister mentioned some of the constitutional discussions that we have started to have in the European Union.
We are continu@@ ing to follow the internal situation of that country closely and we would say, unfortunate@@ ly, that with the ex@@ cep@@ tion of the free@@ ing of A@@ un@@ g S@@ an Su@@ u K@@ y@@ i last J@@ ul@@ y, no significant improvements have been no@@ ted to date.
Re@@ gar@@ ding your question, I was saying to you that these au@@ ster@@ ity measures will be observed by the Portuguese people and that, although it is a t@@ ou@@ gh, on@@ er@@ ous pack@@ age, we will do everything to increase economic grow@@ th, create more employment and es@@ cap@@ e these difficul@@ ties.
Re@@ ligi@@ ous tolerance needs to be promo@@ ted both by those that hold political power and at gr@@ ass@@ roo@@ ts level.
It is down this road that the rapporteur has g@@ one, while of course inc@@ or@@ por@@ ating certain other things, two of which I would like to highligh@@ t.
It should be stres@@ sed that the key weap@@ ons in fi@@ gh@@ ting the diseas@@ e remain prevention, education and adhe@@ rence to the rules of hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e, which makes it possible to avoid inf@@ ec@@ tion with the tu@@ ber@@ c@@ le bac@@ ill@@ us.
This is very bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re.
In this regard, I believe that the measures we should adopt should include an increase in monitoring and inspection and the clari@@ fication of quality indic@@ ator@@ s, and they should be of diff@@ ering typ@@ es, and, above all, it seems to me extremely important to ensure that training be established throughout the territory.
Furthermore, following the Laeken inv@@ it@@ ation, the Commission tabled a new amen@@ ded proposal on family re@@ uni@@ fication on 2 May in order to make it easier to find a consensus on this extremely sensitive issue.
The next item is the debate on the report (A@@ 5-01@@ 2@@ 3@@ /200@@ 0@@ ) by Mr Sch@@ mit@@ t, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and H@@ ome Affairs, on the Commission W@@ or@@ king Do@@ cu@@ ment: T@@ ow@@ ards common standards on asy@@ lu@@ m procedures [@@ (SEC(@@ 1999@@ ) 2@@ 7@@ 1 - C@@ 5-01@@ 5@@ 7@@ /@@ 1999 - 1999@@ /21@@ 4@@ 8@@ (C@@ O@@ S)]
In the UK, we do not currently subscri@@ be to the Euro@@ vi@@ g@@ net@@ te sche@@ me.
(FR) Mr President, I should like to make a personal statement and ask the Member who has just spoken to a@@ po@@ logis@@ e.
Finally, I should like to say a few words about democratic scrutin@@ y, another target of criticism in the resolution.
Gre@@ ater market transparency is also needed.
in writing. - (FR) The two reports put to the vote today - one on the common foreign policy and the other on the security and defence policy - have one thing in comm@@ on@@ : they take the Member State@@ s' foreign and defence policies away from them to the advantage of the civil ser@@ v@@ ants in Brussel@@ s.
We understand that the presidency does not take quite so much interest in such a day@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ day process as the annual budget procedure is now becom@@ ing.
I should like to add a couple more ele@@ ments.
(DE) Madam President, I would particularly like to thank Mr C@@ ash@@ man@@ .
There are a few statements regarding the EU's agricultural budget that we do not agree with, and the D@@ an@@ ish Liber@@ al Party will continue to work to bring about a gradual p@@ ha@@ sing out of the EU's agricultural ai@@ d.
For example many of you have mentioned the question of energy security - which is important - and the question of the consequences of climate change in all its dimen@@ sions, the question of how to tackle the responsibility that we have with disasters that are natural and not man@@ made, for which we have resources and cap@@ ab@@ ili@@ ties that have been put in place to comb@@ at such d@@ ram@@ atic event@@ s.
By the same to@@ ken@@ , given that the labour market is becoming ever more deman@@ d@@ ing, it is important for flexible working conditions to take into account key valu@@ es such as the balance between family and profes@@ si@@ onal life …
But there is a lack of effective legal re@@ medi@@ es and en@@ force@@ ment.
Al@@ so, it is very strange that the He@@ ad@@ s of State and Government in T@@ amp@@ ere made gran@@ di@@ ose statements about a European immigration policy, but we do not know if these will actually be con@@ ver@@ ted into Community L@@ aw@@ .
In view of the size of its budget, the Joint Un@@ der@@ taking should establish an audit committee.
All these projects conta@@ in very practical proposals for combating for@@ ced prostitution.
Commissioner, we are certainly not calling for protectionist measures or a return to the o@@ ld ideas of import du@@ ties, but for a Europe that stands strong and firm in making China respect the rules to which it has itself subscribe@@ d.
Mr President, on 9 June 2004 the previous Commission took the decision to termin@@ ate the contr@@ acts of 4@@ 3 language teach@@ ers.
My criticism is primarily aimed at the way in which, with the van den Bo@@ s report, we have taken an un@@ am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ous stand for religious freedom throughout the world, wh@@ il@@ st at the same time treating the statement by C@@ ard@@ in@@ al R@@ at@@ z@@ in@@ ger and the Ca@@ tho@@ lic Ch@@ ur@@ ch on sa@@ me@@ -@@ sex partnerships as some sort of violation of human rights.
There is indeed every reason for doing so@@ .
On the other h@@ and, the financial perspec@@ tive: a budget that meets every@@ one@@ ’s expect@@ ations, a strong budget for a powerful Europe and not just a few co@@ ins casu@@ ally put on the table by the Council, like some sha@@ b@@ by ti@@ p.
The Council already agreed it would approve Parliament's posi@@ tion@@ ; th@@ us, a first@@ -@@ reading agreement is to be assu@@ me@@ d.
I think that it would make sense if you as Commissioner supported the view that the l@@ ate payment directive should also apply to the European institutions, because then payment could be made, if there was a legal basis, within a certain period of time, namely between 2@@ 1 and 3@@ 0 days or, we hope, even so@@ on@@ er.
Rec@@ itals E, F and G make this clear, stressing that terrorism is on the increase in almost all the European countries and that the nature of terrorism is changing radic@@ ally, but that there are al@@ so, according to recital G@@ , in particular, international networks enjo@@ ying strong - as the recital says - logis@@ tical and financial support.
That is a very important point that I want to get across today.
Mr President, as far as Mrs van L@@ anc@@ ker@@ 's questions are concerned, there are ten basic objecti@@ ves, which I simply sp@@ li@@ t into three categories in order to simpli@@ fy my present@@ ation; but there are still ten basic objectives co@@ ver@@ ing adequ@@ ac@@ y, financial sustainability and modernis@@ ation.
Not by any stre@@ t@@ ch of the im@@ ag@@ ination did I, however, at any time think that the Commission did its accoun@@ ts on an E@@ x@@ ce@@ l spre@@ ad@@ sh@@ e@@ et so that the figures could be ad@@ jus@@ ted without any@@ one@@ 's know@@ ing.
Since 199@@ 5@@ , this has reached almost EUR 7@@ m under the European initiative for democrati@@ sation and human rights.
However, we do not agree with the powers that this proposal for a directive gives to the European Commission, particularly the possibility for Commission de@@ part@@ ments to carry out '@@ chec@@ ks on emerg@@ ency stocks and dedic@@ ated stoc@@ k@@ s' in Member States.
If there is no technical follow-@@ up, then our demands will obviously remain a de@@ ad le@@ t@@ ter@@ .
But it is just because of this that we have to do all we can to re@@ vi@@ ve rail trans@@ port@@ ation and support its gradual open@@ ing up to competition.
It is a very different country today compared to what it was, say, five years ago.
One is an urgent matter@@ : the College of Commissioners must be approved in December in Stras@@ bourg.
We must not therefore sanc@@ tion this type of political approach.
The Commission already has a won@@ der@@ ful process of consultation in place with social partner@@ s.
Mr Sch@@ mi@@ d, who was the rapporteur on this very complex subject, concent@@ rated on general network and information security network issues, not just on E@@ ch@@ el@@ on.
This decision undoubtedly weak@@ en@@ ed the energy self-@@ suffici@@ ency not only of Slovak@@ ia, but also of the European Union.
It is also true.
Once again@@ , however, I have to speak on behalf of many pension@@ ers, who ask me when they will have rules forcing banks to give pension@@ ers more money and to be more w@@ illing to give loans to the el@@ der@@ ly who, having few years left to li@@ ve, have tr@@ ou@@ ble obtaining loans because they do not have much time to repay them.
in writing. - (HU) I would like to congratulate my colleague Christ@@ a K@@ la@@ ß on her report, which highligh@@ ts the difficulties that women living in rural areas have to face in the labour market and in other aspects of their lives.
N@@ atur@@ ally it is the African leaders who must mediate in the first instance but, if the situation th@@ reat@@ en@@ s to es@@ cal@@ ate further before Mr An@@ nan@@ 's arri@@ val, the EU itself will have to be ready to join with the African Union in sending a high-@@ level delegation to N@@ ai@@ ro@@ b@@ i without dela@@ y.
I believe that in the creation of that Convention sp@@ ir@@ it, which has been the key to this succ@@ ess, you have played a leading role, Mr President.
I agree with you@@ .
It enab@@ les financial investments to be made in greater energy efficiency and in the use of renew@@ able energy sources in resid@@ ential build@@ ings.
That would be the ans@@ w@@ er.
In@@ cid@@ ent@@ ally, it therefore appeared necessary to all concerned to set a deadline within which to ask the Commission to express its opinion on the rest of the matter.
In this case, the resources in question are gol@@ d, ir@@ on and b@@ au@@ x@@ ite.
Indeed, if we wish to adopt manag@@ eable and re@@ li@@ able migration policy, in which refuge@@ es are entitled to protection and in which we create transparent opportunities for legal migr@@ ation, then an approach that takes due account of all disc@@ ouraging and encouraging factors that lead to illegal immigration is a necessary measure.
It is also our duty to suggest practical solutions for ending the war and to call on the EU to comm@@ it itself to these in its role within the Qu@@ ar@@ te@@ t.
W@@ e, therefore, recommend to Parliament that it post@@ p@@ one granting discharge for the Council@@ 's budget.
The Commission's proposal focus@@ es on the resear@@ ch@@ -@@ related aspec@@ ts.
The two parties have linked intere@@ st@@ s.
It also needs joint initiatives to promote economic growth in developing countries, sustainable development, the elimination of hunger and the reduction of poverty on E@@ ar@@ th.
The Joint Resear@@ ch Centre can certainly make a major contribution to this - and not just in the nuclear fiel@@ d.
G@@ o and ask Mrs H@@ ul@@ th@@ é@@ n and the European Parliament' - and that is why I am asking you now - '@@ to think not just about the future survival of man@@ kin@@ d@@ ' - an excellent thing, which is why I voted for the motion - '@@ but also about the survival of man@@ kind right now, which is all too often not a very che@@ ering subject but which I feel is really important for us here at this time@@ .'
We heard this message very clearly in K@@ ig@@ ali@@ , and I must say to the Commission that the t@@ one of negotiations is very important too, not just the substan@@ ce.
We must try to reduce the number of vehicles on our ro@@ ad@@ s, but there is no guarantee that this directive would do that.
Many people do not agree with that war and I respect their view@@ s but I ask that this C@@ ham@@ ber respec@@ ts the position of the men and women whose lives are at risk.
It is the shareholders of the group and their r@@ ing@@ lead@@ er, Bar@@ on Sel@@ li@@ è@@ re of the employers' feder@@ ation in F@@ ran@@ ce, Me@@ def@@ , who, by with@@ drawing their capit@@ al, were responsible for the collapse of Air Lib@@ .
When drawing conclu@@ sions from the consultation exerc@@ ise, com@@ pu@@ ter@@ -@@ implemented inv@@ en@@ tions were not in any way on my min@@ d.
We do not want that either.
Let me remind you of what J@@ ama@@ ic@@ a said. Am@@ bas@@ s@@ ad@@ or Mr R@@ and@@ s@@ for@@ d S@@ m@@ ith said that we regret that the draft tex@@ ts presented to this ministerial conferen@@ ce, as at the outcome of the Genev@@ a preparatory process, do not sufficiently reflect or cap@@ ture the position and proposals of developing countries.
I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate Serbia's leaders and people on their efforts and on the progress that they have been making.
I cannot accept that it is impossible for us to find an additional EUR 15 million in the vast budget that we will be approving here in a shor@@ t period of time.
We would like to mention the fact that the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the Charter of Fundamental Rights prohibit collective exp@@ ul@@ si@@ ons.
The report also recommen@@ ds that the European Union should focus on five priority areas.
We would all benefit from this.
President Bar@@ ro@@ so suggested that next year the EP@@ A discussions should be held at the highest level with each of the regions concerned, to fin@@ al@@ ise the agreements with a view to reasonable economic integration.
And those who have remained are regularly attac@@ ked and, in many cases, kil@@ led.
Y@@ et, through L@@ EA@@ DE@@ R@@ , there can be no doub@@ ting its effec@@ tiveness as an integr@@ al part of b@@ ro@@ ader EU and national policy.
We are focus@@ ing, for example, on the citizens' initiative, mentioned by several speak@@ er@@ s; the implementation of the new provisions for working with national parliament@@ s; the accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, and also the external action service, just to mention a few of the things that need good preparation without anti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ing.
The system of eco@@ points itself could be one solution.
Mr S@@ tur@@ d@@ y' s proposal to take the pres@@ sure off the market by organising subsi@@ dies in such a way that in@@ ste@@ ad of beef more ve@@ al is produced - from c@@ rated cal@@ ves, that is - is the he@@ i@@ ght of c@@ yn@@ ic@@ ism.
I hope the media will remember that and re@@ ali@@ ze that it is not the European Parliament which is hi@@ ding or dis@@ sembl@@ ing about fra@@ ud@@ ; we are ex@@ posing it and offering that analysis to the rest of the Union.
This is a remar@@ k@@ able u@@ -@@ turn on research and it certainly shows up all those Sunday speeches we heard in this House.
There is agreement in principle between the employers' and the employe@@ es' sid@@ es, and we want to see this reflected in the G@@ ros@@ ch report.
At present, this is being manag@@ ed through a variety of program@@ m@@ es.
Is this because of the matters Mrs Bu@@ it@@ en@@ we@@ g raised about Member States not wan@@ ting to use these fund@@ s?
That is why we urge national parliaments to take up this issue, in order to sh@@ ed every possible light on what has really taken place on their territory.
In looking to the future and thin@@ king of what we must leave for future gener@@ ations, Parliament can do a lo@@ t.
N@@ ational central banks and taxpayers will ensure a sa@@ f@@ e lan@@ ding for the golden par@@ ach@@ u@@ ti@@ st@@ s, and that will not come che@@ ap@@ .
I would therefore have expected the proposal to place a major emphasis on involving the citizens in such dialogue.
   Mr President, Mr Fr@@ at@@ t@@ ini@@ , ladies and gentlemen, the report presented to us today by Mr C@@ at@@ ania calls into question the policy of zer@@ o tolerance and prohi@@ bi@@ tion implemented by the Member States.
We are also strugg@@ ling with the rapporteur@@ ' s no@@ tion that what we want to reach in 201@@ 0 shoul@@ d, in actual fact, be reached in 2004.
We need a common approach in the European Union and in the Member States, in cooperation with the third countries in question.
I would also very much recommend that we pay greater attention not only to working with the energy produc@@ ers, but also to establ@@ ishing dialogue with consum@@ ers.
We have to be aware that if there is no Constitu@@ tion, there will also be no Charter of Fundamental Righ@@ ts.
I would strongly highlight the fact that partnerships between parliament@@ ari@@ ans, EU and UN Member State govern@@ ments, institutions and civil socie@@ ty are vital for building support for the agreed go@@ als and objectives of the action programme of the international conference on population and development as regards the Millennium Development Goals.
The Union is nothing if it is not a ju@@ ri@@ dical community, as Mr H@@ än@@ sch rightly said.
In 199@@ 7@@ , as a consequence of the procedures for approval of the Ma@@ a@@ stric@@ h@@ t Treaty – which had caus@@ ed problems in some Member States – the issue of how the Union could be brought closer to the citizens was ad@@ ded as an agenda it@@ em@@ .
It is still left up to national rules to li@@ mit how far the funds can go into debt, and that also means that we are not lear@@ ning the lessons from the crisis.
The situation in these pris@@ ons is in@@ descri@@ bab@@ le.
C@@ an she say what sort of time@@ -@@ scale is involved in arran@@ ging for Ireland - currently a sing@@ le@@ -@@ zone territory for Objective 1 status - to be divi@@ ded into more than one region so that areas in the west of Irel@@ and, from D@@ one@@ g@@ al down along the coast to South K@@ er@@ ry or W@@ est Cor@@ k, might be still considered for Objective 1 area status in the post@@ 1999 program@@ me@@ ?
Y@@ our broad interest in the issues definitely encoura@@ ges both the High Representative and myself to put together efforts to help people build peaceful lives.
S@@ tu@@ dies esti@@ mate@@ , frigh@@ ten@@ ingly, that by 2020 ne@@ uro@@ -@@ p@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ ri@@ c dis@@ order@@ s, with de@@ pres@@ sion at the top of the list, will be the high@@ est@@ -ran@@ king cause of ill@@ ness in the developed world.
In the history of Europe, parliaments have always been the conscience of the n@@ ation. And parliaments cannot make such com@@ promises as we unfortunately must some@@ times accept on the part of governments.
The projects announ@@ ced by the Commission in the new strategy for commodities and raw materi@@ als, aimed at sec@@ uring transparency and stability on the commodities marke@@ ts, are therefore wel@@ com@@ e.
This group of experts, then@@  – @@ the committee chaired by An@@ d@@ r@@ é S@@ ap@@ ir@@  – @@ made an extremely clear propos@@ al@@ : re-@@ direct the European institu@@ tion@@ s@@ ’ budget, the 1.@@ 25% of European G@@ D@@ P, which is only a small amount but is being put to very poor use and does not serve to contribute towards European grow@@ th.
I really believe that if we, as the European Parliament and the European Union, want to have an influ@@ ence in this specific matter then having an ac@@ ross-@@ the@@ -@@ bo@@ ard agreement on the principles of such a position is very important.
Mr President, it is vital that this report should be approved so that a decision can be taken at the next Fisheries Council on the re@@ struc@@ turing programme for the fle@@ et that oper@@ ated in Mor@@ occ@@ o and that has been id@@ le since the end of 1999, affecting Portuguese and Spanish f@@ ish@@ erm@@ en and shi@@ pow@@ n@@ ers and the popul@@ ations of the areas where they li@@ ve.
Secondly, the world's major pro@@ lif@@ er@@ ation in the p@@ ast dec@@ ad@@ es has not been P@@ y@@ ong@@ y@@ an@@ g but P@@ ak@@ istan@@ .
At a time when the maritime borders of my country, of Ital@@ y, M@@ al@@ t@@ a and Greece are demon@@ str@@ ating their great weakn@@ ess, we would like the F@@ ron@@ te@@ x Ag@@ ency to have at least the same capacity for dep@@ lo@@ y@@ ment of vessels and resources for control@@ ling and protecting our maritime borders as we are approving today for the Mar@@ itime Safety Ag@@ ency.
   – Mr President, I wanted us to talk about a very serious issue.
However, attemp@@ ts to b@@ ind those of us outside the euro zone with targets and proc@@ esses designed to harmon@@ ise economic policy are unacceptable@@ .
This case constitu@@ tes a pat@@ ent abuse of the discre@@ tion that the Commission enjo@@ ys when interpreting its oblig@@ ations.
But the most important requirement is that all available instruments should serve agreed European policy objectives in any given situation.
My question was on exactly the same wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ th.
It is essential to encourage the efforts aimed at increasing EU investments with regard to di@@ versi@@ fication of cross-border struc@@ tu@@ res@@ , incentives for gener@@ ating altern@@ ati@@ ve, non-@@ conventional forms of energy at local level and improvements in the infrastruc@@ ture@@ 's ability to facilitate connection to new energy sour@@ ces.
The work that has been carried out in terms of super@@ vision, organis@@ ation and regul@@ ation, to which you have refer@@ red, Mr President, is excell@@ ent.
Pri@@ ority must be given to the sustainable development of the European econom@@ y.
I voted for this regulation precisely to ensure lower char@@ ges for ro@@ am@@ ing custom@@ ers, while at the same strengthening the rules on transparency of pric@@ ing.
The EU institutions are working more effici@@ ently than e@@ ver@@ .
Un@@ til the European Constitution is adop@@ ted, which I hope can be done so@@ on, we will have to make do with the legal instruments we ha@@ ve, and there is little we can do with those instruments, but I am very pleased that the Commission is ge@@ aring its work, first@@ ly towards a Communication and, possi@@ b@@ ly, towards a proposal for a Directive, as Mr W@@ u@@ erm@@ el@@ ing sugges@@ ts.
The Commissioner agre@@ es that shortcomings in the working methods of credit r@@ ating ag@@ en@@ cies are widely recogn@@ ised today as having contributed to the financial crisis.
The new provisions of the common security and defence policy (C@@ S@@ D@@ P@@ ) introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon provide a clearer legal framework for reinforcing the implementation of foreign and security policy, drawing upon all the instruments available to the EU and its Member States, to prevent and manage crises and conflic@@ ts, and to build la@@ sting peac@@ e.
On the contrary, the Islam@@ ist Taliban is growing in streng@@ th.
In this case, the U@@ K In@@ dependence Party, which I have the hon@@ our to repres@@ ent, strongly supports the immediate setting up of an in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y into the Commission's hand@@ ling of this matter.
To pa@@ ve the way for this is exactly the in@@ tention of the Laeken Declar@@ ation.
What a pity for the people of Zimbab@@ we - all the people of Zimbab@@ we@@ .
Indeed, with the current rate@@ s of investment, the pace of growth of the economy of the Community in the future can only be very s@@ low@@ , which is in@@ comp@@ ati@@ ble with the need to create job@@ s.
I was never a Communist and I have always condem@@ ned Commun@@ ism.
The Commission is therefore pressing h@@ ome all these poin@@ ts, which are relevant issues, but it cannot go so far as to micromanage every@@ thing.
This is why I have launched this initiative in the form of an oral question to the Commission with a debate and a resolution. I am very grateful for the fact that this resolution has been supported by all the groups in the House.
The Commission should publ@@ ish regular reports or other announ@@ ce@@ ments stating what has been achieved.
B@@ et@@ ter sti@@ l@@ l, it is u@@ su@@ ally beneficial and should therefore be encourage@@ d.
This could be an excellent start to making the necessary ambitious changes in the form of a joint effort by the Commission and the European Parliament and, at the same time, to developing a budget which looks to the future and is combined with greater political legitim@@ acy. This is what Parliament is calling for very strongly and collec@@ tively in this report.
Therefore, we welcome the work that Mrs Bal@@ z@@ an@@ i has done.
Con@@ sequ@@ ently, the G@@ 7 meeting approach@@ ed the problem from the right an@@ g@@ le by stating that the benefits gener@@ ated by g@@ lo@@ bal@@ iz@@ ation must be distributed to all, rich and poor ali@@ ke@@ .
The opportunities for mobility have had the totally oppos@@ ite effect for them@@ , making discrimination worse.
At the same time, I have to conclude that, if the Commission wants to ad@@ here to these three good principles, then it must, at some point or ano@@ ther, disagree with the note which the Presidency has sub@@ mitte@@ d.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, May@@ 's summit in S@@ am@@ ara ex@@ posed the cr@@ ac@@ ks in our strategic partnership with Russia - on energy, on Kosovo and on human rights.
However, special rules come into play in the case of a pers@@ on who, during their last employment, was resid@@ ing in a state other than in the state of insuran@@ ce.
Organ@@ ised crime
The fir@@ st, of course, as the rapporteur her@@ self has said, is the extension of the scope of the Re@@ g@@ ulation from feed to animal welf@@ are and animal heal@@ th.
This relatively moder@@ ate increase is possible because of a 2% fall in the budget provisions for expen@@ d@@ it@@ ure for the EU of 15@@ .
In this are@@ a, it is again the internal market which is setting the framework for what we are to achieve in the environmental sp@@ here, and countries are punished for taking the lead@@ .
The resolution also takes note of the Venezuel@@ an Govern@@ ment@@ 's statement that it will ab@@ i@@ de stric@@ tly by decisions taken by the judic@@ i@@ ary, and we add that all of the parties should do exactly the same thing.
In the same respect, Mr President, we are asking for the implementation of a global inter@@ regional association agreement that can give institutional support and tot@@ al ge@@ og@@ rap@@ h@@ ical co@@ verage in relations with the sub@@ contin@@ ent, in order@@ , amongst other things, not to be second rate when compared with the developments that are being made in the United States.
That is why regional development cannot take place without natur@@ al, technological or environmental risk pre@@ vention.
(C@@ S) On the recent visit undertaken by the Committee on Transport and T@@ our@@ ism to L@@ at@@ via and E@@ st@@ onia, the problem of transport links between the Baltic States and neighbouring regions was, quite righ@@ tly, a major top@@ ic of discus@@ sion.
We are going to want to get our parliamentary committees involved in this.
If that hap@@ pen@@ s, we will then have the opportunity to hear how he intends to tackle the serious crisis in his country.
I hope the Commission will ensure that this spirit of transparency is extended to its investigation of any wrong@@ doing by M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el E@@ mer@@ s@@ on and that Parliament is given a full account of any possible mis@@ use of European funding or the granting of consul@@ tan@@ ci@@ es.
At the EU@@ -@@ A@@ SE@@ A@@ N ministerial meeting and the A@@ R@@ F ministerial meeting on 28 and 2@@ 9 Ju@@ ly in L@@ a@@ os, the Union again vo@@ ic@@ ed its concerns about the situation in Bur@@ ma@@ .
The second point is about bio@@ fu@@ el@@ s.
You will in any event have to make the political price for President A@@ h@@ m@@ ad@@ ine@@ j@@ ad unacceptably high@@ .
What lessons should the EU learn from all of this@@ ?
We tri@@ ed to find out what happened regarding mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to ne@@ ts.
This report and the public at large are right to say that while we acknowledge Chin@@ a's competitive advantage in particular in labour-intensive produc@@ tion, it is only just that our inte@@ l@@ lec@@ tu@@ al proper@@ ty is equally acknowled@@ ged and protec@@ ted.
However, in this instance there is one point that I have had to address on many occasions.
In the growth strategy, as has been said, it is necessary for the Pact to take into account economic c@@ y@@ c@@ les and structural reform@@ s: this is necessary, but it is not suffici@@ ent.
If reports are to achieve any@@ thing, they must focus on specific prior@@ ities, as we all know from our years of practical experience here in Parliament.
The third stage of Economic and Mon@@ et@@ ary Union is upon us.
In contr@@ ast to what the report s@@ ays, only traditional fam@@ ili@@ es and social respect for mo@@ ther@@ hood provide the remedy we need.
   .
They have all been per@@ su@@ ade@@ d@@ !
I would like to thank the services of the European Parliament, particularly the transl@@ ation services, and the secretari@@ at of my committe@@ e, for their very har@@ d, precise and quic@@ k work, without which it would not have been possible to achieve what we have achieved.
It will be expensi@@ ve, but not to take action would be still more expensi@@ ve.
   Mr President, in recent weeks the Lukashenko reg@@ im@@ e has made yet another addi@@ tion to its list of dubious practic@@ es.
I am grateful to you for the atten@@ tive words in connection with the work of the O@@ S@@ C@@ E, which is currently stri@@ ving primarily for fair elections, improvement of security and political dialogue between the presidential can@@ di@@ d@@ ate@@ s.
Therefore, the only realis@@ tic way out of this situation, the only way to prevent the collapse of the currency market is st@@ op@@ -@@ gap help for Greece as well as long-@@ ter@@ m, pl@@ anned action to stabil@@ ise the position of the euro.
   I would just like to say that the Turkish P@@ ub@@ lic Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ or has already lost twice in this particular case, and that the judgment expected shor@@ tly, which will undoubtedly go the same way, will be fin@@ al.
Con@@ flic@@ ts of interest will arise and we will have to resolve them by means of effective coordination within and among countries.
E@@ ven@@ ts taking place in Venezuel@@ a are extremely worr@@ y@@ ing, as they are yet another example of the flag@@ rant abuse of human and civil rights in countries which call themselves democrac@@ ies, such as Cub@@ a, China or Venezuel@@ a.
Mr President, many thanks for the answer given by the Commissioner, which stated that irregular@@ ities have indeed taken place.
D@@ o not get me wrong@@ ; Mr Ma@@ at@@ 's report is s@@ ound and consider@@ ably impro@@ ves the Commission's plan.
In view of the importance of this Pro@@ to@@ col@@ , the Commission has already asked the Council for a mandate for its re@@ negotiation.
It will affect millions of small businesses and millions of individuals who carry on economic activities, even though this may not as yet be appa@@ ren@@ t.
As it is not really possible to change the sha@@ pe of the vehic@@ les, the eng@@ ine@@ ers will have to focus on the eng@@ ine and the mechan@@ ical com@@ pon@@ ents, which, according to the experts, is a long-@@ win@@ ded process.
To that en@@ d, our institutions need to work closely together and the European Parliament has to be fully consulted in its role, y@@ es, as joint polic@@ y-@@ ma@@ ker for Europe, but more import@@ an@@ tly as the citizens' representative in the key political act that is the adoption of the budget.
Pro@@ posing a defin@@ iti@@ ve list of products would not be fe@@ asi@@ ble because the electr@@ ical and electron@@ ics market is a rapid@@ ly changing one, so the directive would have to be revised continually and would never be up to date.
As stated in the resolution we are about to vote on, Turkey has form@@ ally me@@ t all the conditions for accession talks to begin on 3 O@@ c@@ to@@ ber.
We know that inf@@ rin@@ ge@@ ments are taking place to@@ day, and we therefore want the Commission to tigh@@ ten up monitoring and, where necessary, use the tool@@ s available to tempor@@ ari@@ ly su@@ spen@@ d offen@@ ding countries.
It is therefore legi@@ timate to include the services market in bilateral and multi@@ l@@ ateral trade negoti@@ ations.
The L@@ e@@ ader II programme has already achieved good results in this area.
Mr President-in-O@@ ffic@@ e, when the nomination of a President of the Commission is discussed under your presidency, we urge you to take the outcome of the European elections into account in your deliberations.
S@@ up@@ port@@ ing these proposals will lead to a mar@@ ked improvement in the Commission’s text and will facilitate its implement@@ ation.
It only remains to ob@@ serve that a compromise is a com@@ promis@@ e.
They simply follow the g@@ es@@ ticul@@ ations of their party tic@@ -@@ ta@@ c men.
(HU) Than@@ k you very much, Mr President.
I don@@ '@@ t think it is right that it should be push@@ ed to one si@@ de.
This would cause problems for in-@@ hou@@ se services within public bo@@ dies such as local hou@@ sing authorities and health bo@@ ards.
I also want to thank the President of the Council for his war@@ m word@@ s.
One hundred and fif@@ ty thousand people c@@ ross the border every day into Luxem@@ bourg.
There are some contro@@ versi@@ al ele@@ ments, however, the first of which is the op@@ t-@@ out.
This is why it is so important that we should be un@@ st@@ in@@ ting in our efforts and should aim our argu@@ ments for the abo@@ li@@ tion of the death penal@@ ty at international for@@ a and el@@ se@@ whe@@ re.
All too of@@ ten@@ , we have become bogged down in the@@ o@@ re@@ tical debates about sources of suppl@@ y, about nuclear energy, for nuclear energy, against nuclear energy, et@@ c.
The PP@@ E Group feels that this de@@ parts from the agreed lin@@ e, which was that an@@ ne@@ x@@ es con@@ taining only technical figures should be avo@@ ided in this kind of directive.
The European Parliament' s resolution demands that this change to the tre@@ ati@@ es results in a constitution for the EU, that is to say, a decisi@@ ve step of sor@@ ts on the way to a federal state.
We talk about more information, but our actions are limited to giving the Member States more money for their information work, while the Member States do not give their own parliaments suffici@@ ent information about their decisions in the Council, and therefore exclude their citizens from European decision making.
A de@@ tailed examination of the oper@@ ation of the credit default s@@ w@@ ap@@ s market is needed.
Common principles on flex@@ ic@@ urity (debate)
I should like to discuss one of the points the Commissioner rais@@ ed, and I would ask him to el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate on this.
S@@ he has made an outstanding contribution to promoting the Lisbon Treaty and facilit@@ ating the integration of the new Member States.
The ad@@ dic@@ ted individual needs to be ac@@ tively involved in these effor@@ ts.
The next item is the debate on the report (A@@ 5-00@@ 7@@ 6@@ /200@@ 2) by Mr Gra@@ ç@@ a M@@ oura@@ , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Polic@@ y, on the Commission communication on an EU Strategy towards Chin@@ a: Implementation of the 199@@ 8 Communication and F@@ u@@ ture Ste@@ ps for a more E@@ ffec@@ tive EU Policy.
E@@ ach research community is best aware of its own needs for investment and development - these should not be too tigh@@ tly controlled by policy.
By means of self-@@ hand@@ ling, which allows ‘@@ no@@ vic@@ es’ to do do@@ c@@ k work and to hand@@ le car@@ go@@ , this text introduc@@ es social du@@ m@@ ping and calls safety arrange@@ ments into question.
It also continually h@@ ush@@ es up crime.
The question is rather, what means do we wish to employ in order to achieve this objective.
The possible approval of ex@@ -@@ Commissioner B@@ ol@@ ken@@ ste@@ in@@ ’s services directive means that the economic discrepancies between the Member States will become a competitive factor@@ .
It also congratul@@ ated the people of Ukraine for their continued commitment to the democratic process.
Thir@@ dly, as regards def@@ ending and sel@@ ling, there is a lot of talk about protection@@ ism now@@ ad@@ ays in the European Union.
Ne@@ ver@@ the@@ l@@ ess, I remain concerned about restric@@ tions on press freedom and media pl@@ ur@@ alis@@ m.
That is why Parliament should continue to provide its unanimous support.
A European transparency initiative - of the kind I have tal@@ ked about on a number of occasi@@ ons in Parliament - is in the process of being develo@@ pe@@ d.
They do not need to be protected from themselves and they do not like being tre@@ ated as children and being asked to leave the roo@@ m when sex is being discus@@ se@@ d.
Com@@ itology (debate)
This in@@ direct response is not without risk.
V@@ ast discrepancies between the E@@ P permanent staff@@ , the temporary staff of the groups and the assistants are not jus@@ ti@@ fi@@ ed, particularly as the@@ y, to a large ex@@ t@@ ent, do the same type of work.
S@@ o@@ lid@@ ar@@ ity is extremely important.
Lastly, Mr W@@ at@@ son, a word on the Guantanamo ques@@ tion: you speak Italian well, you understand it very well and I hope you read it too, because, according to the reports I have read in the Italian pres@@ s, it appears that, on more than one occasi@@ on, the Presidency of the Council has called on the US authorities to respect human rights in Guantanamo as well.
Ladies and gentlemen, that is an issue which greatly concerns us all.
There@@ fore it is a very serious problem.
In line with the framework agreement that exists between Parliament and the Commission, the point will be raised within the Commission, with a view to very care@@ fully examining its position in these circumstan@@ ces.
And this is not a new situ@@ ation: the situation has existed since 199@@ 6 when President Lukashenko ab@@ ro@@ g@@ ated the elected parlia@@ ment, and chan@@ ged the constitution to invest all the execu@@ tive powers in the presid@@ ent, i.e. his own pers@@ on.
Let us make it a pre@@ condi@@ tion for this directive coming into effect that an eth@@ ical committee shall be established and shall be a central part of our decision-making process.
There must be visi@@ ble efforts by all industri@@ alised countries – not only the EU – to reform their far@@ m policies@@ ; and a substantial and real – not just pa@@ per – reduction of industrial tariffs by all countries in a position to do this, including the adv@@ anced developing countries, always respec@@ ting the special circumstan@@ ces of the weak@@ .
We must also adopt a global perspective, as the Commission has done.
So far this approach is an outstanding success so why should we not employ the same policy in our trading relations with our neighbour@@ s?
On 15 Mar@@ ch 2007@@ , the Council re@@ affir@@ med its support for urgent consideration of further measures against Sudan by the UN Security Council, poin@@ ting out that under UN Security Council Resolution 15@@ 9@@ 1 anyone h@@ in@@ dering the peace process must be called to account and appropriate measures taken.
Finally, thanks to the Interne@@ t, a vast range of economic and cultural sectors are being trans@@ for@@ med, and a range of new opportunities are offered to small and medium-sized busin@@ ess@@ es.
With initial data that is more precise we can reduce the prob@@ ability of errors in the sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o@@ s fo@@ rec@@ ast.
One of the main@@ st@@ ays of RE@@ AC@@ H is the re@@ versal of the bur@@ den of pro@@ of@@ , yet there are those in this House who even want to do away with this ide@@ a.
With the increase in air travel@@ , now is the time to set standards on safe@@ ty.
This is in fact the ti@@ tle of Gu@@ y As@@ nar@@ 's book.
There is no doubt that some of the amendments on which we voted today are per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly in order@@ .
China must allow the UN High Commissioner of Human Rights into Ti@@ be@@ t to carry out a thor@@ ou@@ gh and impartial investigation into the events there to date.
We can@@ not, however, over@@ look the difficulties that some Member States have had in recent years in ke@@ ep@@ ing public defic@@ its within the levels of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Not only should Euro@@ po@@ l and Euro@@ ju@@ st, too, closely cooperate, but - in my personal judgment - this close cooperation is best guaranteed by their being based at one loc@@ ation.
I would reply to them in adv@@ ance that, thanks to this market economy, the average income of our fellow citizens has ris@@ en by 4@@ 0% over the last 40 years.
We accept Amendment No 14@@ , but with a less ri@@ gi@@ d word@@ ing, and Amendment No 1@@ 6 only par@@ ti@@ ally. We cannot accept Amendment No 1@@ 2 because it is not clear to us how people who are shareholders as a result of choices made by the managers of institutional investment funds can be involved in the procedure for car@@ r@@ ying out a take@@ over bi@@ d.
D@@ is@@ par@@ ities in health between countries, between regions, between rich and po@@ or, between different eth@@ ni@@ c minor@@ ities, affect each and every EU Member State and, in many plac@@ es, they are getting wi@@ der@@ .
In case the point is not clear, let me explain that the honourable Member is refer@@ ring to the pre@@ sumed decision of the German presidency. Since then there has been a Spanish presidency.
The debate is closed.
I want to express my sympa@@ thy to the family members affec@@ ted, but also to those who, in the sp@@ ace of just a few h@@ ours, lost everything that they had spent their lives building u@@ p.
The following questions have been submitted to the Council.
We are also working along these lines in appl@@ ying the Cotonou Agree@@ ment.
One of the principles of sustainability is to deal with issues at the sm@@ all@@ est level.
To@@ day, we are pil@@ ing ri@@ dic@@ ule on sha@@ me.
How can we con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate releas@@ ing GMO@@ s if manufacturer@@ s do not accept their full liability and if we do not have a directive which regul@@ ates the issue of trac@@ eability and label@@ ling of GMO@@ s.
The Commission is grateful for the wide-ranging discussions that have taken place here today.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, congratul@@ ations to Mrs K@@ ol@@ ar@@ sk@@ a@@ -@@ B@@ ob@@ i@@ ń@@ sk@@ a and also to the sha@@ do@@ w rapporteur from my group, Mrs U@@ l@@ v@@ sk@@ o@@ g and the other rapporteur@@ s on their excellent work.
In the case of the h@@ ill trib@@ es in particular, the Vietnam@@ ese government can obviously only deal with these problems at a local level and that is where they must be dealt with.
If we look at EU foreign policy, it is easy to see that there are some gaps in it. We naturally want to f@@ ill those gap@@ s.
I would therefore propose that during each Council presidency - in other words twice a year - a special meeting of the Council should take place.
Although at international conferen@@ ces atten@@ ded by various state@@ s we all agree that we really must imple@@ ment these documents to which we all subscribe@@ , such efforts f@@ requ@@ ently ce@@ as@@ e on the last day of the conference and the status qu@@ o remains un@@ change@@ d.
It w@@ oul@@ d, of course, be in@@ appropriate to set ourselves up as jud@@ ges of a Member State govern@@ ment: what we need to do is record in a single list, comp@@ are and take stock of the different initiatives taken at all levels - at European level, by the Member States, the local authorities and the Commission - to address the consequences of these two terrible ship@@ w@@ rec@@ ks.
We need it now, and we need the fund to achieve what it was originally designed to do@@ .
It would also have the effect of supporting the local economy and the local ship@@ building industry, which need support in this emerg@@ ency.
I agree with Mr Corbett there because we have asked for adequate represent@@ ation of both sex@@ es.
That was a sight to be@@ hold for someone used to a system where voting is easy.
That is why G@@ e@@ or@@ gi@@ a deserves our support.
(HU) Madam President, honourable Council, honourable Commission, Member States attempt to react to the crisis they find themselves in through individual solutions and their own respon@@ ses.
My second point is that it is the ag@@ ency that must also stop the un@@ controlled spread of conta@@ min@@ ating transgenic products that are even inf@@ es@@ ting traditional cereal crops, since consumers are rejec@@ ting transgenic crops, whose only vi@@ r@@ tu@@ es are commerci@@ al.
It depends on our will to build a more stable world.
C@@ ar production is among the areas wor@@ st affected.
In 2000 the EU had 4@@ 50 000 tonnes of olive oil in st@@ or@@ age, and the EU decided to run advertising campai@@ gn@@ s in the northern countries to in@@ form us how good and beneficial olive oil w@@ as.
I would like to ask the Commission when we will have the new An@@ im@@ al Transport Direc@@ tive.
Unfortunately, we are all also aware that resources, including financial resources, are not always the main limit@@ ation.
We have a quite exciting debate in f@@ ront of us.
Now we are facing the risk of the very oppos@@ ite.
The PP@@ E@@ -@@ DE@@ ' s amendment was rejec@@ ted by a margin of 11 votes, and we therefore feel it is cohe@@ rent with our initial position to ab@@ stain from the final vote on the tex@@ t.
I took part in this delegation as a member of the Committee on Development and Co@@ oper@@ ation, and one of the major top@@ ics in Jo@@ h@@ ann@@ es@@ bur@@ g was of course the way in which development is finan@@ ce@@ d.
From the report it appears that only around 30% of the complaints to the Ombudsman fall within his sphere of responsibility.
It is important that these EU airlines can compete against the American airlines which have received state aid from the American Government in recent tim@@ es.
The Ombudsman should rest assu@@ red that in time he will be b@@ om@@ bar@@ ded with our complain@@ ts.
Y@@ o@@ M com@@ prises 28 key actions and concrete measures to increase the education and training of young people through mobility and eas@@ e their transition from education into the labour market.
W@@ hatever our personal feelings on this or other subjec@@ ts, we need to work within the exis@@ ting legal frame@@ work@@ s.
   . The undertakings made by the Ma@@ ur@@ it@@ an@@ ian Government as regards respect for democratic principles when the consul@@ t@@ ations were opened under Ar@@ tic@@ le@@  @@ 9@@ 6 were cent@@ red on the re-@@ establ@@ ish@@ ment of a proper@@ l@@ y-@@ func@@ tion@@ ing democracy and the rule of law.
I should like once again to express my respect for the Jap@@ anese people.
In the light of the economic crisis, it seems in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ble that we are increasing the EU budget.
All older people should have the right to have access to health care@@ , w@@ hatever their ag@@ e.
Th@@ ree princip@@ al factors have affected these relations.
That is why our group is princip@@ ally in favour of no don@@ ations from businesses for political par@@ ties, so as to v@@ ou@@ ch for the independence of Parliament as an institution and of the individual M@@ P@@ s.
on behalf of the E@@ F@@ D Group. - Mr President, I will be bri@@ ef to compen@@ s@@ ate for the time that Mr Por@@ ta@@ s too@@ k.
That is totally unaccep@@ table as far as we are concerned.
In the current situation, charac@@ ter@@ ised by the men@@ ace of a serious rec@@ ession in the US economy, as well as the pers@@ istent need to raise the rate of growth in Europe, deb@@ t re@@ payment as well as tax reduc@@ tions see@@ m to us of l@@ es@@ se@@ r importance than financing public investment, naturally in balanced budge@@ ts, not defic@@ its, both for supporting flag@@ ging growth and for pushing forward those structural changes necessary for the transition to a modern@@ , technolog@@ ic@@ ally pi@@ one@@ ering, full employment economy in Europe.
We find this unacceptable@@ !
Y@@ ester@@ day, we had another tra@@ ge@@ dy, in the S@@ t Go@@ t@@ th@@ ard tun@@ n@@ el@@ .
I agree that B@@ ay of B@@ isc@@ ay sole could be moved to a management plan in accordance with its less serious bio@@ logical state@@ , but W@@ ester@@ n Ch@@ an@@ nel sole should remain the subject of a recovery plan.
I ask with in@@ s@@ is@@ ten@@ ce, Mr Commissioner and Madam R@@ ap@@ porte@@ ur@@ , why, for a prof@@ ession that is exactly the same as many other@@ s, for example, the medical profes@@ sion, we need either a work placement or an exam@@ in@@ ation@@ ?
Does the Council consider it necessary to he@@ igh@@ ten awa@@ ren@@ ess of the problem and provide funding for measures such as the above to protec@@ t the environment and health of future European gener@@ ation@@ s?
This kind of initiative depends on competition between large numbers of public and private organisations, including the c@@ ar industry, telecommunications operator@@ s, equip@@ ment provi@@ ders, mo@@ tor@@ way operators and in@@ sur@@ ance compani@@ es.
Therefore, though I can only applaud the fact that this U@@ top@@ ia is becoming a reality within the European Union, I do think that we should show a little more mo@@ d@@ est@@ y.
What we are de@@ tec@@ ting at the moment is that there is no control mechanism for activities c@@ ros@@ sing national border@@ s.
This is a subject of particular importance to our citizens.
The over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming majority of the T@@ ai@@ wan@@ ese people do not in any event wish to be subject to the same control.
For example, it is currently estimated that, in 2009@@ , the fin@@ s of 2@@ 6 million to 7@@ 3 million sh@@ ar@@ ks en@@ te@@ red the global tra@@ de.
Some proposals have been made along these lin@@ es, but I think we should have no illu@@ sions and that we must be aware of the objective limit@@ ations and difficulties of this approach.
The obstacles they face include language bar@@ ri@@ ers, an un@@ fam@@ ilia@@ r working environment, family or cultural traditions, and so on.
I think you are right, Mr @@ Ver@@ ho@@ f@@ st@@ ad@@ t.
We particularly question why the EU should support the priv@@ ati@@ sation of banks in Serbia and Mon@@ ten@@ e@@ g@@ ro@@ .
To sum up, although it is the responsibility of the movement to reflect on its future, starting with the methods it should use to fight glob@@ alisation, and to reflect on the danger of it encouraging un@@ focus@@ ed, pro@@ voc@@ ative protectionist ten@@ den@@ ci@@ es, the task of ori@@ ent@@ ing the global process@@ es, which have hitherto fav@@ ou@@ red economic concent@@ r@@ ations, spec@@ ul@@ ative investment and wide gaps and in@@ toler@@ able in@@ justic@@ es, f@@ all@@ s to the institu@@ tion.
With regard to the em@@ bar@@ go on ex@@ ports of B@@ ri@@ ti@@ s@@ h be@@ ef, you are aware of all the decisions taken by the F@@ lo@@ rence European Council.
We can be s@@ atis@@ fied with the progress made within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on several poin@@ t@@ s: a stric@@ ter definition of the use of ph@@ y@@ top@@ har@@ m@@ ac@@ eu@@ tical produc@@ ts, ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary treat@@ ments and national der@@ og@@ ation@@ s; increased monitoring at the cer@@ ti@@ fication st@@ age, including monitoring of im@@ ported produc@@ t@@ s; and an extension of the scope of the regulation and the consolidation of regul@@ atory committe@@ es.
We must recognise the importance of the fact that the regions are a re@@ al@@ ity, and that this reality is relevant not only in terms of governance.
However, what is important for us is the analysis of the 25% of complaints accep@@ ted, tw@@ o-@@ thir@@ ds of which rel@@ ate to the European Commission, in other words, the Community institution which takes decisions which impact on citizens.
This is too important to sc@@ ore che@@ a@@ p political points.
In this House, there is firm cross-@@ party resolve to keep on remin@@ ding the world, including Bur@@ m@@ a and Tur@@ ke@@ y, of the f@@ ate of these two women and of the strugg@@ le for human rights, democracy and freedom of expres@@ sion that they repres@@ ent.
This is a step.
The previous inc@@ um@@ b@@ ent was Belgium and during its si@@ x@@ -@@ month term of office not only the countr@@ y' s Prime Minister and other government minister@@ s, but also the government leaders and minister@@ s of the various Belgian regions, appeared before the European Parliament and chaired some of its meet@@ ings.
We should rec@@ all that Parliament spo@@ ke out against this situation a year ago, yet even the Commission has ad@@ mitted that nothing has been done on the subjec@@ t.
These phenomen@@ a are the result of structural changes that ac@@ company the social and economic development of our society.

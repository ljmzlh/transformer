The Commission has a responsibility, but protecting the environment is not sufficiently high on its agenda.
By treating beneficiaries of international protection equally in all Member States, such a measure puts an end to the inequalities which have hitherto existed between Member States and will allow the individuals in question to reside in a Member State other than the one in which they gained legal recognition, something which did not happen previously.

But that is not how we see the targets in the guidelines and not how we expect the Member States to react.
It is in these terms that the issue of when to adopt the euro must be considered.
Besides the fact that the EU and the United States share a number of common interests and values, such as the promotion of peace, democracy, respect for human rights, and the market economy, they have the world's most important bilateral trade and investment relationship: the transatlantic economy is worth USD 4 280 billion.

On biotechnology, I am sure you are at least partly right.
However, this document is over-prescriptive in its approach and tries to micromanage all areas of external action including setting up an EU Institute of Gender Equality without recognising the strides made by all EU institutions to make every opportunity available to female staff.
One must always stress that the great majority, as I believe, do things by the book.
Mr Poettering and Mr Barón Crespo, I hereby confirm the commitment I made to you yesterday on behalf of the Commission on the status of European political parties. The Commission will shoulder its responsibilities.

The Commission can confirm that the appointment of a Portuguese official as Director-General for Press and Communication was firmly based on the principles that were set out by the Prodi Commission when we took office in 1999, and specifically those principles which require that merit is the prime consideration in taking appointment decisions and that every effort should be made consistent with the provisions of the staff regulations, to respect the need for a balance of nationalities in senior management positions.
But what is the future to be?
The previous legislation, which did not allow a citizen of a third country with a long-stay visa granted by a Member State to travel to other Member States, did not meet the mobility needs of the majority of those citizens.
And I wonder whether you really believe that you can get this issue, in which Parliament has also been involved since Amsterdam in terms of codecision, approved.

There are also reports that speak of some Taliban military successes and of a return to what passes for a sort of grim normality in Kabul.

Greater market transparency is also needed.
in writing. - (FR) The two reports put to the vote today - one on the common foreign policy and the other on the security and defence policy - have one thing in common: they take the Member States' foreign and defence policies away from them to the advantage of the civil servants in Brussels.
We understand that the presidency does not take quite so much interest in such a day-to-day process as the annual budget procedure is now becoming.
I should like to add a couple more elements.

My criticism is primarily aimed at the way in which, with the van den Bos report, we have taken an unambiguous stand for religious freedom throughout the world, whilst at the same time treating the statement by Cardinal Ratzinger and the Catholic Church on same-sex partnerships as some sort of violation of human rights.
There is indeed every reason for doing so.
On the other hand, the financial perspective: a budget that meets everyone’s expectations, a strong budget for a powerful Europe and not just a few coins casually put on the table by the Council, like some shabby tip.

That is a very important point that I want to get across today.

This group of experts, then – the committee chaired by André Sapir – made an extremely clear proposal: re-direct the European institutions’ budget, the 1.25% of European GDP, which is only a small amount but is being put to very poor use and does not serve to contribute towards European growth.
I really believe that if we, as the European Parliament and the European Union, want to have an influence in this specific matter then having an across-the-board agreement on the principles of such a position is very important.
Mr President, it is vital that this report should be approved so that a decision can be taken at the next Fisheries Council on the restructuring programme for the fleet that operated in Morocco and that has been idle since the end of 1999, affecting Portuguese and Spanish fishermen and shipowners and the populations of the areas where they live.

The work that has been carried out in terms of supervision, organisation and regulation, to which you have referred, Mr President, is excellent.
Priority must be given to the sustainable development of the European economy.
I voted for this regulation precisely to ensure lower charges for roaming customers, while at the same strengthening the rules on transparency of pricing.
The EU institutions are working more efficiently than ever.
Until the European Constitution is adopted, which I hope can be done soon, we will have to make do with the legal instruments we have, and there is little we can do with those instruments, but I am very pleased that the Commission is gearing its work, firstly towards a Communication and, possibly, towards a proposal for a Directive, as Mr Wuermeling suggests.
The Commissioner agrees that shortcomings in the working methods of credit rating agencies are widely recognised today as having contributed to the financial crisis.
